 # Latest Advancements in RAG Every Developer Should Know!
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines the powers of large pre-trained language models with external retrieval or search mechanisms. The idea is to enhance the capability of a generative model by allowing it to pull information from a vast corpus of documents during the generation process.
Here's a breakdown of how retrieval augmented generation works:
### An Ideal RAG Pipeline
An ideal RAG pipeline will have the following ingredients.
⮕ A textual corpus of documents from which you want to extract information, such as PDFs, Notion pages, Slack conversations, OneNote notes, and so on
⮕ An embedding model
⮕ A vector database like SingleStore [try for free: https://lnkd.in/gfR2nqcU]
⮕ A prompt and an LLMIn the context of RAG, using a framework like LangChain is a good idea. LangChain, a framework for interfacing with LLMs to create chains of operations and autonomous agents.
The flow of operations is summarized in the diagram above.

### Taxonomy of RAG Foundations
Based on how the retriever augments the generator, we can classify the RAG foundation paradigms into 4 distinct classes.
1) Query-based RAG:
Query-based RAG is also called prompt augmentation. It integrates the user’s query with insights from documents fetched during the retrieval process, directly into the initial stage of the language model’s input. This paradigm stands as a widely adopted approach within the applications of RAG.
Once documents are retrieved, their content is merged with the original user query to create a composite input sequence.
This enhanced sequence is subsequently fed into a pre-trained language model to generate responses.
2) Latent Representation-based RAG:
In the framework of Latent Representation-based RAG, the generative models interact with latent representations of retrieved objects, thereby enhancing the model’s comprehension abilities and the quality of the content generated.
3) Logit-based RAG:
In Logit-based RAG, generative models combine retrieval information through logits during the decoding process. Typically, the logits are summed or combined through models to produce the probability for stepwise generation.
4) Speculative RAG:
Speculative RAG looks for opportunities to use retrieval instead of generation to save resources and accelerate response speed. REST replaces the small models in speculative decoding with retrieval, so as to generate drafts. GPTCache tries to solve the problem of high latency when using the API of LLMs by building a semantic cache for storing LLM responses.

### Sentence Window Retrieval
This advanced RAG technique retrieves not just the most relevant sentence, but a window of sentences around it for higher quality context.
The core idea behind Sentence Window Retrieval is to selectively fetch context from a custom knowledge base based on the query and then utilize a broader version of this context for more robust text generation.
This process involves embedding a limited set of sentences for retrieval, with the additional context surrounding these sentences, referred to as “window context,” stored separately and linked to them.
Once the top similar sentences are identified, this context is reintegrated just before these sentences are sent to the Large Language Model (LLM) for generation, thereby enriching overall contextual comprehension.
By narrowing the focus to a specific window of sentences, sentence window retrieval aims to enhance precision and relevance in information extraction, facilitating a comprehensive synthesis of text.
Know more about Sentence Window Retrieval in these articles.
### Tree RAG (T-RAG)
Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization’s hierarchy.
Evaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation.
Workflow of Tree-RAG (T-RAG):
For a given user query, they search the vector database for relevant document chunks to be used as context. Additionally, if the query mentions entities from the organization, information about them is extracted from the entities tree and added to the context. They finetuned the Llama-2 7B model on an instruction dataset generated from the organization’s document. They use the finetuned model for response generation.
Their system differs from the typical RAG application in the Query process. Instead of using an existing pre-trained LLM, they use a finetuned version of the LLM for answer generation; they finetuned the LLM model on an instruction dataset of questions and answers generated based on the organization’s document.
A feature of T-RAG is the inclusion of an entities tree in addition to the vector database for context retrieval. The entities tree holds information about entities in the organization and their location within the hierarchy.
Each node in this tree represents an entity with the parent node indicating the group it belongs to.
During retrieval, they use the entities tree to further augment the context retrieved by the vector database.

### MultiHop-RAG
Existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence.
Furthermore, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries.
In real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, a user’s query often necessitates retrieving and reasoning over evidence from multiple documents, a process known as multi-hop query.
For instance, consider financial analysis using a database of financial reports.
A financial analyst might query, Which company among Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit margins in their third-quarter reports for 2023? or inquire about a specific company’s performance over time, such as How does Apple’s sales trend look over the past three years?
These queries require evidence from multiple documents to formulate an answer.
Due to the multifaceted nature of such queries, involving information from various sources, traditional similarity matching methods like cosine similarity between query and financial report chunk embeddings might not yield optimal results. This is where MultiHop-RAG plays a vital role.
This paper (link at the end) demonstrate the benchmarking capabilities of MultiHop-RAG using two experiments, utilizing a RAG system implemented with LlamaIndex.
The first experiment involves a comparison of different embedding models for retrieving relevant evidence for multi-hop queries.
Second experiment assesses the reasoning and answering abilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM, Claude-2, Llama2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B, for multi-hop queries when retrieved text is provided.

### Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation
CRAG stands for Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation.
It significantly enhances the performance of RAG-based models.
It is an approach to enhance language models, specifically those that use a retrieval-augmented generation framework. The primary purpose of CRAG is to improve the robustness and accuracy of the information that the model uses to generate responses.
In traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, the system retrieves documents from a database (local corpus) based on a user query and then generates an answer based on the information in those documents. However, if the retrieved documents are not relevant or contain incorrect information, the answer generated by the model will likely be incorrect as well.
CRAG addresses this issue by introducing a few key components:
1. Retrieval Evaluator: After the initial retrieval of documents, CRAG uses a retrieval evaluator to assess the quality of the retrieved documents. It classifies them as correct, ambiguous, or incorrect with respect to the given query.
2. Knowledge Correction: If the retrieved documents are not entirely correct, CRAG activates a knowledge correction mechanism. It searches both the local corpus and the public web to find and integrate additional information that corrects or supplements the initial retrieval.
3. Knowledge Refinement: This process involves breaking down the retrieved documents into smaller parts, filtering out irrelevant information, and then reassembling the relevant pieces into a more concise and focused knowledge input for the language model.
4. Generator: Finally, the language model uses both the original query and the refined knowledge input to generate a response. This response should be more accurate as it is based on the most relevant and correct information available.
CRAG aims to mitigate issues related to irrelevant or incorrect information that could compromise the quality of the generated output in RAG models.

### Simple Techniques to Improve RAG
3 techniques to enhance document retrieval in RAG-based applications.
1. Query expansion
2. Cross-encoder re-ranking
3. Embedding adaptors
By incorporating these techniques, you can retrieve more pertinent documents that closely match the user’s query, thereby increasing the impact of the generated answer.
1. Query expansion:
Query expansion refers to a set of techniques that rephrase the original query.
👉 Query expansion with a generated answer
Given an input query, this method first instructs an LLM to provide a hypothetical answer, whatever its correctness.
Then, the query and the generated answer are combined in a prompt and sent to the retrieval system.
👉 Query expansion with multiple related questions
This second method instructs an LLM to generate N questions related to the original query and then sends them all (+ the original query) to the retrieval system.
2. Cross encoder re-ranking:
This method re-ranks the retrieved documents according to a score that quantifies their relevancy with the input query.
To compute this score, we will use a cross-encoder.
A cross-encoder is a deep neural network that processes two input sequences together as a single input. This allows the model to directly compare and contrast the inputs, understanding their relationship in a more integrated and nuanced way.
3. Embedding adaptors:
This method leverages user feedback on the relevancy of the retrieved documents to train an adapter.
An adapter is a lightweight alternative to fully fine-tune a pre-trained model. Currently, adapters are implemented as small feedforward neural networks that are inserted between layers of pre-trained models.
The underlying goal of training an adapter is to alter the embedding query to produce better retrieval results for a specific task.
An embedding adapter is a stage that can be inserted after the embedding phase and before the retrieval. Think about it as a matrix (with trained weights) that takes the original embedding and scales it.

 # Agentic RAG
Alright, let’s get straight to the meat of the matter — understanding the Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach and how it’s revolutionizing the way we handle information. Buckle up, because this is about to get wild!
At its core, **Agentic RAG **is all about injecting intelligence and autonomy into the RAG framework. It’s like giving a regular RAG system a major upgrade, transforming it into an autonomous agent capable of making its own decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Pretty cool, right?
# But what exactly does this mean in practice? Well, let me break it down for you.
**Context is King:** One of the biggest limitations of traditional RAG implementations was their inability to truly understand and factor in the broader conversational context. Agentic RAG agents, on the other hand, are designed to be context-aware. They can grasp the nuances of a dialogue, consider the history, and adapt their behavior accordingly. This means more coherent and relevant responses, as if the agent is truly engaged in a natural conversation.
**Intelligent Retrieval Strategies:** Remember how RAG systems used to rely on static rules for retrieval? Boring! Agentic RAG agents are way smarter than that. They employ intelligent retrieval strategies, dynamically assessing the user’s query, available tools (data sources), and contextual cues to determine the most appropriate retrieval action. It’s like having a personal assistant who knows exactly where to look for the information you need.
**Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Now, here’s where things get really interesting. Complex queries often span multiple documents or data sources, right? Well, in the world of Agentic RAG, we’ve got a little something called multi-agent orchestration. Imagine having multiple specialized agents, each an expert in their own domain or data source, collaborating and synthesizing their findings to provide you with a comprehensive response. It’s like having a team of experts working together to solve your toughest problems.
**Agentic Reasoning:** But wait, there’s more! Agentic RAG agents aren’t just good at retrieving information; they’re also equipped with reasoning capabilities that go way beyond simple retrieval and generation. These agents can perform evaluations, corrections, and quality checks on the retrieved data, ensuring that the output you receive is accurate and reliable. No more worrying about getting questionable information!
**Post-Generation Verification:** And just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Agentic RAG agents can perform post-generation checks. They can verify the truthfulness of the generated content, or even run multiple generations and select the best result for you. Talk about attention to detail!
**Adaptability and Learning:** Here’s the real kicker — Agentic RAG architectures can be designed to incorporate learning mechanisms, allowing the agents to adapt and improve their performance over time. It’s like having a system that gets smarter and more efficient the more you use it. How’s that for future-proofing?
# Agentic RAG Reference Architecture Demystified
Alright, now that we’ve got a good understanding of what Agentic RAG is all about, let’s dive into the reference architecture that makes this whole thing work.
At the heart of this architecture, we have the Agentic RAG Agent — the intelligent orchestrator that receives user queries and decides on the appropriate course of action. Think of it as the conductor of a symphony, coordinating all the different instruments (tools) to create a harmonious performance.
Now, this agent isn’t alone in its endeavors. It’s equipped with a suite of tools, each associated with a specific set of documents or data sources. These tools are like specialized agents or functions that can retrieve, process, and generate information from their respective data sources.
For example, let’s say you have Tool 1, which is responsible for accessing and processing financial statements, and Tool 2, which handles customer data. The Agentic RAG Agent can dynamically select and combine these tools based on your query, enabling it to synthesize information from multiple sources to provide you with a comprehensive response.
But wait, where does all this information come from? That’s where the documents or data sources come into play. These can be structured or unstructured, ranging from databases and knowledge bases to textual documents and multimedia content. They’re like the raw materials that the tools work with to craft the final product.
Now, let’s say you ask the agent a complex question that spans multiple domains or data sources. Here’s where the magic happens: the Agentic RAG Agent orchestrates the entire process, determining which tools to employ, retrieving relevant information from the associated data sources, and generating a final response tailored specifically to your query.
Throughout this process, the agent leverages intelligent reasoning, context awareness, and post-generation verification techniques to ensure that the output you receive is not only accurate but also tailored to your needs.
Of course, this is just a simplified representation of the reference architecture. In the real world, Agentic RAG implementations may involve additional components, such as language models, knowledge bases, and other supporting systems, depending on the specific use case and requirements.

## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

# Understanding Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a cutting-edge approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generation-based models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The term “agentic” emphasizes the model’s ability to act autonomously, making decisions based on retrieved information to generate responses.
# Agentic RAG Architecture
## The Core Components
The architecture of Agentic RAG is built upon two primary components: the retriever and the generator.
**Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant information from a vast corpus of data. It uses sophisticated search algorithms to find the most pertinent pieces of information based on the input query.**Generator**: Once the retriever has fetched the necessary information, the generator takes over. It uses this information to craft coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This component typically relies on advanced transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
## Integration and Workflow
The workflow in an Agentic RAG system begins with the input query, which is processed by the retriever. The retriever’s output is then fed into the generator, which produces the final response. This integration ensures that the generated content is not only contextually relevant but also enriched with accurate information retrieved from external sources.
# Agentic Framework in LLM
The agentic framework in large language models (LLMs) is a significant enhancement over traditional models. It allows the model to autonomously retrieve and integrate information, leading to more dynamic and informed responses.
## Autonomous Information Retrieval
In a traditional LLM, the model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate responses. However, in an agentic framework, the model actively retrieves additional information in real-time. This autonomy ensures that the model’s outputs are not limited to its training data, enabling it to provide more up-to-date and accurate information.
## Dynamic Response Generation
By combining retrieved information with its generative capabilities, an agentic LLM can produce responses that are both informative and contextually appropriate. This dynamic response generation is particularly beneficial in applications requiring precise and current information, such as customer support, research, and content creation.

Recently, Agentic RAG has emerged as a new and powerful AI technique. In this blog, we’ll examine the problems with traditional RAG, then dive into the next advancement in the field of large language models (LLM)—agentic RAG—and explore its features and benefits.
A typical RAG pipeline involves:
- Data Indexing
- User Query
- Retrieval & Generation
**Problems with Traditional RAG:**
**Summarization issues:**Summarizing large documents can be tricky. The traditional RAG framework retrieves the top K chunks and may miss crucial information if the document is extensive.**Document comparison challenges:**Comparing documents effectively is still a hurdle. The RAG framework tends to pull random top K chunks from each document, often leading to an incomplete comparison.**Structured data analysis needs:**Handling structured data queries, such as determining an employee's next leave based on their region, proves to be a challenge. Accurate retrieval and analysis of specific data points aren't spot-on.**Dealing with multi-part questions:**Tackling multi-part questions remains a limitation. For instance, identifying common leave patterns across all regions in a large organization is difficult when constrained to K chunks, which limits comprehensive analysis.
**Now, to overcome these limitations, Agentic RAG comes to the rescue**. Agentic RAG = Agent-based RAG implementation
**Beyond Traditional RAG: Adding Agentic Layers**
Agentic RAG revolutionizes the way questions are answered by introducing an agent-based framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), Agentic RAG employs intelligent agents to tackle complex questions that require:
- Intricate planning
- Multi-step reasoning
- Utilization of external tools
These agents act like expert researchers, adeptly navigating multiple documents, comparing information, generating summaries, and delivering comprehensive and accurate answers. It’s like having a team of specialists working collaboratively to meet your information needs. Whether you need to compare perspectives across documents or synthesize information from various sources, Agentic RAG agents are equipped to handle the task with precision and efficiency.
**Why Agentic RAG?**
An AI agent is essential for:
**Reasoning:**Determining which actions to take and their sequence.**Task Management:**Using agents instead of LLMs directly for tasks requiring planning, multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and learning over time.
In the context of RAG:
- Agents enhance reasoning before selecting RAG pipelines.
- Improve retrieval or re-ranking processes within a pipeline.
- Optimize synthesis before responding.
This approach automates complex workflows and decision-making for non-trivial RAG use cases.
**Agentic RAG Benefits:**
**Orchestrated question answering:**Breaks down the process into manageable steps, assigns appropriate agents, and ensures seamless coordination for optimal results.**Goal-driven:**Agents understand and pursue specific goals, allowing for more complex and meaningful interactions.**Planning and reasoning:**Agents can determine the best strategies for information retrieval, analysis, and synthesis to answer complex questions effectively.**Tool use and adaptability:**Agents leverage external tools and resources, such as search engines, databases, and specialized APIs, to enhance their information-gathering and processing capabilities.**Context-aware:**Systems consider the current situation, past interactions, and user preferences to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.**Learning over time:**Agents are designed to learn and improve, expanding their knowledge base and enhancing their ability to tackle complex questions.**Flexibility and customization:**The framework provides exceptional flexibility, allowing customization to suit specific requirements and domains.**Improved accuracy and efficiency:**By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and agent-based systems, agentic RAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in question answering.
RAG Agents can be categorized based on their functions, including ** routing, one-shot query planning, tool use, Reason + Act (ReAct), and dynamic planning & execution**. These functions vary in complexity, cost, and latency and range from simple, low-cost, low-latency tasks to complex, high-cost, high-latency operations.
For example:
**Routing Agents (aka Routers):**The routing agent relies on an LLM to select the appropriate downstream RAG pipeline. This process is known as agentic reasoning, since the LLM analyzes the input query to determine the best-fit RAG pipeline. It represents the most straightforward form of this type of reasoning.
One scenario may involve choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to route it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine.
**Query Planning Agent**: It simplifies a complex query by dividing it into smaller, parallelizable sub-queries. Each sub-query can be executed across various RAG pipelines that are linked to different data sources. The individual responses from these pipelines are combined to form the final response.
In essence, the process involves breaking down the query into manageable parts, executing them across suitable RAG pipelines, and finally merging the results into a coherent response.
Several other flows are there based on the functionalities and use cases.
Agentic RAG represents a significant advancement in the field of large language models. By incorporating custom agents that can interact with multiple systems, automate reasoning, and dynamically select the best tools for the task at hand, Agentic RAG addresses the shortcomings of traditional RAG. This makes it a more effective solution for handling complex queries and a wider range of use cases.

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process.

### Result19:
 In the latest episode of the RAG Masters show, we explore Agentic RAG, different techniques to build, integrate, and evaluate it, real-world use cases, and future challenges the field might face.
## Understanding Agentic RAG: A Technical Breakdown
To leverage Agentic RAG effectively, let's first break down its core components and how they integrate.
At its core, RAG enhances language models with external knowledge. RAG fundamentally helps to augment prompting by retrieving information from a store of documents or data and then passing key pieces of information to the language model.
AI Agents, meanwhile, are systems designed to reason, act, and observe in a continuous loop. They make decisions, use tools, and adapt to new information - mimicking human problem-solving processes.
Agentic RAG combines these approaches. It creates a system that retrieves and uses information from both documents and the environment, and it can make decisions about how to use that information in a broader context. It's akin to developing a super smart assistant with a vast knowledge base and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve complex problems.
### The ReAct Architecture: Implementing the Core of Agentic Systems
The ReAct architecture (not to be confused with the JavaScript library of the same name) forms the backbone of many Agentic RAG systems. ReAct, in this context, stands for Reasoning and Act.
RAG Masters co-host Daniel Warfield describes it as "a pretty rigid structure where you ask a question, then you tell the model a few things. For example, I want you to break it into sections and every section I want you to think of something specific."
Watch the full clip for a more detailed breakdown of ReAct:
This architecture creates a cycle of thought, action, and observation. The agent thinks about what it needs to do, takes an action (which could be using a tool like RAG or making a specific API call), observes the result, and then thinks again. This cycle allows the agent to break down complex tasks and approach them systematically.
## Flexibility and Multiple Tools: Beyond Simple RAG
A key advantage of Agentic RAG is its flexibility. While RAG on its own is a powerful tool, it's not the only one an agent can use. In fact, an agent could access a whole toolkit of different functions depending on its purpose and goal.
Warfield points out, "You can have the agent request a type of tool they might want and then get back that tool, which can be done with RAG. So not only are the tools themselves RAG, you can build a retrieval engine for retrieving tools that are described textually."
This approach allows the agent to become a flexible problem-solver, adapting its strategy based on the task at hand.
### Real-World Applications: From Medical Claims to Call Centers
The real-world applications for Agentic RAG are varied and have not yet been fully explored.
In the medical field, for example, Agentic RAG could revolutionize claim processing. Instead of a simple keyword search, a system with this tech under the hood could understand the context of a particular claim, cross-reference it with medical knowledge from a structured database, and then make nuanced decisions about its validity and take action based on its decision.
In customer service, the impact is already being felt. As noted in the podcast, "For example, call centers. There's been some call center applications that are scary good at traversing the standard call center script where you have a graph… basically they build an agent that kind of goes through and has text to speech and speech to text on top." Some of these early systems are already highly effective and can understand customer queries, retrieve relevant information, and navigate complex decision trees to provide accurate and helpful responses.
As the technology advances and techniques in both Agentic AI and RAG improve, it’s likely we’ll see more and more complex approaches spread through different industries over time.
### Performance Metrics and Evaluation
When implementing Agentic RAG systems, it's crucial to put evaluation metrics in place and accurately track them. These are a few example key indicators an evaluation might include:
**1**. **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks the agent successfully completes based on a specific rubric or success scale.
**2. Decision Accuracy**: How often the agent makes the correct decision or provides accurate information.
**3. Response Time**: The time taken to complete a task or provide a response.
**4. Tool Usage Efficiency:** How effectively the agent uses its available tools.
### Challenges and Considerations: The Hallucination Problem
Agentic RAG has its potential challenges and pitfalls, as with any sophisticated AI system. One of the most significant issues is hallucination - when AI systems generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
This problem gets amplified in Agentic systems due to their complexity and the number of potential variables that could go awry. If one part of the system starts to hallucinate, it may cause the agents to experience a sort of shared hallucination that poses risks for reliability as the clip below describes.
When it comes to verifying the outputs and functionality of an Agentic RAG system, there are a number of challenges to consider. Verifying a system at each step of the process can quickly become unwieldy as the system grows in complexity.
As Warfield notes in the below clip, "The verification process of an agentic system is the same as the verification of RAG, but way harder because now it's also wrapped around an agent. So you can still have the core RAG that fails, and then you can also have the agent that fails, and it can fail in terms of how it thinks, in how it structures the tool execution...it can snowball really quickly."
While there is no silver bullet for a perfect Agentic system, the following strategies could help to mitigate hallucinations:
1. **Fact-checking:** Cross-reference generated information with trusted sources.
2. **Confidence scoring:** Implement a system where the agent rates its confidence in its outputs.
3. **Human-in-the-loop validation**: For critical applications, include human oversight to verify important decisions.
### Integration with Existing Systems
Integrating Agentic RAG into existing systems has a lot of potential, but requires careful architectural planning.
Here's one high-level approach:
1. **Define **clear APIs for communication between the Agentic RAG system and existing components.
2. **Build **a robust data pipeline to feed relevant information into the RAG knowledge base.
3. **Design **a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the agent's performance based on real-world interactions.
4. **Implement **proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for when the agent fails or produces low-confidence results.
### Conclusion
As we look to the future of Agentic RAG, it's clear that it’s a powerful but complex technology.
The episode closes with an apt analogy: "What do we do with this crazy fast car we just got? Maybe in the next episode Daniel tries to figure out how to drive AI without crashing the car."
This describes the current state of Agentic RAG - we have a powerful vehicle, but we're still learning how to drive it safely. The technology may be production-ready in some areas, especially where the problem space is well-defined like for some call center applications. However, for more open-ended or critical applications, careful design and testing are crucial.
As developers, our challenge is to harness the power of Agentic RAG while managing its complexities. This involves not just understanding the technical aspects of implementation and integration, but also tackling issues of reliability, user experience, and more.
The potential for Agentic RAG is huge. It could be the backbone for AI systems that are more flexible, more capable, and better able to handle complex, multi-step tasks. But realizing this potential in production-ready applications will require ongoing research, careful implementation and testing, and a deep understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of these systems.

 # Deep Dive into Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (A-RAG)
## Overview
Most of us are now familiar with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It starts off with a query input into a RAG pipeline which does retrieval, reranking, synthesis and gets back a response.
Beyond the above naive implementation there are many flavours of RAG that address specific requirements for improving the efficiency and accuracy of response generation. In this article we will not be delving in to RAG architectures per se, but will talk about why, how and what of making RAG more agentic.
Jerry Liu, LlamaIndex co-founder/CEO delivered an excellent keynote on Beyond Naive RAG: Adding Agentic Layers. In this article we will do a deep dive of the agentic RAG concepts (with code implementations). This is necessary for one to go from concepts to learning to implementation. This article brings together most of the knowledge base in to one coherent whole and has been collated from diverse sources of information. Not the least being LlamaIndex's documentation itself. One more point to note is that I implemented agentic RAG using LlamaIndex as it has the best abstractions for RAG. However the principles described here can be used to implement Agentic RAG from scratch in any other framework.
## Why of Agentic RAG
An AI Agent is required when we use reasoning to determine which action(s) to take and in which order to take them. Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!!!
Agency : The ability to take action or to choose what action to take
In the context of RAG, we can plug in agents to enhance the reasoning prior to selection of RAG pipelines, within a RAG pipeline for retrieval or reranking and finally for synthesising before we send out the response. This improves RAG to a large extent by automating complex workflows and decisions that are required for a non trivial RAG use case.
## How of Agentic RAG
Usage patterns for Agents in a RAG context comprises of the following:
-- Use an existing RAG pipeline as a tool by an agent
-- Use an agent itself as a RAG tool
-- Use an agent to retrieve tools from a RAG (Vector index) at query time using a provided context.
-- Use an agent to do query planning over a set of existing tools
-- Use an agent to select a tool from candidate tools which have been retrieved from a pool of tools using RAG.(This is especially useful when we have a large set of tools to select from)
One can also mix and match the above usage patterns to realise a complex RAG application.
RAG Agents can be further classified based on function. They can be used for routing, one-shot query planning, tool use, reason + act (ReAct) and dynamic planning and execution. These range from simple, low cost and low latency to complex, high cost and high latency.
### Routing Agent
Routing agent essentially uses an LLM to pick what downstream RAG pipeline to pick. This is agentic reasoning as it uses an LLM to reason about what RAG pipeline to pick based on the input query. This is the simplest form of agentic reasoning.
Another class of routing is to select between Summarization and Question Answering RAG pipelines. Based on the input query the agent reasons about routing to the Summary query engine or the Vector Query Engine that are configured as tools.
### One-Shot Query Planning Agent
Query Planning agent breaks down a complex query in to parallelizable sub queries. Each sub query can then possibly executed against a set of RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The resulting responses from each RAG pipeline is then synthesised in to the final response. Essentially in query planning, the first step is to decompose into sub queries, then execute each sub query against appropriate RAG pipeline (data sources). Once the results of the sub queries are generated, they are synthesized in to a final response.
### Tool Use Agent
In standard RAG, a query is just passed in to get the top k documents semantically matching the query. However there are times when we need to get data from an external API, a SQL Database or an application that exposes an API, which can then be used as additional context to the input query before sending it to the LLM. In such scenarios the agent can use a RAG toolspec.
### ReAct Agent
ReAct : Reason + Act with LLMs
The next step up is to add some sort of reasoning and actions which are executed in a loop over a complex query. Essentially it is a superset of Routing, Query Planning and Tool Use all rolled in to one. A ReAct agent can handle sequential multi part query and keep state (in memory). (See the ReAct paper here)
ReAct Agent has the following logic:
## Recommended by LinkedIn
### Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent
ReAct is by far the most popular agent so far. However there is a need for handling user intent that is more complex. Also more and more agents are deployed in production settings that require higher reliability, observability, parallelization, control and separation of concerns. Essentially we need long term planning, execution insight, efficiency, optimization and reduce latency.
Two papers have been published in the recent past that address this:
At a high level these attempt to separate the higher level planning from short term execution. The logic for such agents is:
So we would need a planner and a executor. The planner most likely will be using an LLM to take the user query and generate a step by step plan. The executor can then take each step and figure out which tools if any are required to complete the task defined in the step. This process continues until the whole plan is executed and the final response is shown.
Langchain has a Plan and Execute agent (still experimental). Llama Index has a Llama pack for LLMCompiler
### ReAct Vs LLMCompiler
This is at the bleeding edge of development and more improvements in this can be expected. Some areas which can be further improved from the current State of the Art (SOTA) are:
## What of Agentic RAG

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process. In this regard, let’s delve into some potential avenues.

Through harnessing these patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

This allows agents to optimize the selection of tools based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.**Selection of tools from the candidate pool**:
In situations where the RAG system offers a wide array of tools, agents can help choose the most suitable one from the pool of candidate tools retrieved according to the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool aligns closely with the query context and objectives.
These usage patterns can be combined and customized to create complex RAG applications tailored to specific use cases and requirements. Through harnessing these patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

 # RAG in 2024: The Evolution of AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval
*Editor’s note: Laurie Voss is a speaker for **ODSC West** this October 29th-31st. Be sure to check out his talk, “**RAG in 2024: Advancing to Agents**,” there!*
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing AI models with external knowledge. However, as we push the boundaries of what AI can do, we’re discovering that basic RAG has its limitations. While RAG is necessary, it’s not sufficient: we argue that advanced knowledge retrieval requires agentic strategies.
# Basic RAG
RAG works by combining a large language model with a knowledge base. When given a query, the system retrieves relevant information from its database and uses it to generate a response. This approach has proven incredibly useful for tasks that require up-to-date or specialized knowledge.
However, basic RAG systems struggle with more complex tasks. They often fall short when asked to:
- Summarize large documents: your query doesn’t match the whole document, you need software sufficiently aware of the task it was given to adapt with a different strategy
- Compare multiple pieces of information: a single retrieval is unlikely to get all the context you need
- Multi-part questions: queries like “what is the population of the largest city?” really require two questions — what’s the largest city, and what’s the population of that city?
# Advancing Beyond Basic RAG
To overcome these challenges, researchers and developers are taking two main approaches: enhancing data quality and increasing query sophistication. While improving data quality is crucial, the real game-changer is the introduction of agentic RAG systems.
Agentic RAG introduces the concept of AI agents — autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents go beyond simple retrieval and generation, incorporating advanced features that make them more flexible and powerful.
# Components of Agentic Systems
Agentic systems are built on several key components:
**Routing**: Agents can intelligently select the most appropriate tool or method to answer a query. For instance, a RouterQueryEngine can choose between different types of search or summarization tools based on the nature of the question.**Conversation Memory**: Unlike basic RAG, agentic systems can maintain context across multiple interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses.**Query Planning**: Complex queries are broken down into simpler sub-queries that can be processed in parallel, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate responses.**Tool Use**: Agents can interact with external APIs and data sources, adapting queries as needed. This allows them to access a wider range of information and perform actions beyond simple text generation.
# Agent Reasoning Strategies
Agentic systems employ various reasoning strategies to tackle complex tasks:
**Sequential Reasoning**: This includes approaches like the ReAct (Reasoning + Action) pattern, where the agent alternates between thinking about its next step and taking action.**DAG-based Reasoning**: The agent creates a comprehensive plan from start to finish, like a flowchart. It can also reflect on its progress and adjust the plan as needed.**Tree-based Reasoning**: For open-ended tasks, the agent explores multiple possible paths, balancing between exploring new options and exploiting promising leads.
# Advanced Features of Agentic Systems
Modern agentic systems also incorporate advanced features that enhance their usability and effectiveness:
**Observability**: Agents can be instrumented to provide insights into their decision-making processes, aiding in debugging and improvement.**Controllability**: Users can exert fine-grained control over agent actions, which is crucial for human-in-the-loop scenarios.**Customizability**: Agent behaviors can be modified and extended to suit specific use cases.
# AI Agents in LlamaIndex
To adapt to this new reality we have made agentic capabilities a first-class citizen in LlamaIndex: routing, memory, planning, and tool use are all key primitives in our library. Strategies for various types of reasoning are built-in while others are available as downloadable plug-ins from LlamaHub, our registry of open-source AI software. And observability, controllability, and customizability are all foundational to how our framework operates.
**In our talk at ODSC West**, we’ll be going in-depth into the problems that led to this evolution of knowledge retrieval and how we solved them, including step-by-step guides to building agents in the LlamaIndex framework itself. We hope to see you there!

# Understanding Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a cutting-edge approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generation-based models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The term “agentic” emphasizes the model’s ability to act autonomously, making decisions based on retrieved information to generate responses.
# Agentic RAG Architecture
## The Core Components
The architecture of Agentic RAG is built upon two primary components: the retriever and the generator.
**Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant information from a vast corpus of data. It uses sophisticated search algorithms to find the most pertinent pieces of information based on the input query.**Generator**: Once the retriever has fetched the necessary information, the generator takes over. It uses this information to craft coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This component typically relies on advanced transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
## Integration and Workflow
The workflow in an Agentic RAG system begins with the input query, which is processed by the retriever. The retriever’s output is then fed into the generator, which produces the final response. This integration ensures that the generated content is not only contextually relevant but also enriched with accurate information retrieved from external sources.
# Agentic Framework in LLM
The agentic framework in large language models (LLMs) is a significant enhancement over traditional models. It allows the model to autonomously retrieve and integrate information, leading to more dynamic and informed responses.
## Autonomous Information Retrieval
In a traditional LLM, the model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate responses. However, in an agentic framework, the model actively retrieves additional information in real-time. This autonomy ensures that the model’s outputs are not limited to its training data, enabling it to provide more up-to-date and accurate information.
## Dynamic Response Generation
By combining retrieved information with its generative capabilities, an agentic LLM can produce responses that are both informative and contextually appropriate. This dynamic response generation is particularly beneficial in applications requiring precise and current information, such as customer support, research, and content creation.

 In the latest episode of the RAG Masters show, we explore Agentic RAG, different techniques to build, integrate, and evaluate it, real-world use cases, and future challenges the field might face.
## Understanding Agentic RAG: A Technical Breakdown
To leverage Agentic RAG effectively, let's first break down its core components and how they integrate.
At its core, RAG enhances language models with external knowledge. RAG fundamentally helps to augment prompting by retrieving information from a store of documents or data and then passing key pieces of information to the language model.
AI Agents, meanwhile, are systems designed to reason, act, and observe in a continuous loop. They make decisions, use tools, and adapt to new information - mimicking human problem-solving processes.
Agentic RAG combines these approaches. It creates a system that retrieves and uses information from both documents and the environment, and it can make decisions about how to use that information in a broader context. It's akin to developing a super smart assistant with a vast knowledge base and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve complex problems.
### The ReAct Architecture: Implementing the Core of Agentic Systems
The ReAct architecture (not to be confused with the JavaScript library of the same name) forms the backbone of many Agentic RAG systems. ReAct, in this context, stands for Reasoning and Act.
RAG Masters co-host Daniel Warfield describes it as "a pretty rigid structure where you ask a question, then you tell the model a few things. For example, I want you to break it into sections and every section I want you to think of something specific."
Watch the full clip for a more detailed breakdown of ReAct:
This architecture creates a cycle of thought, action, and observation. The agent thinks about what it needs to do, takes an action (which could be using a tool like RAG or making a specific API call), observes the result, and then thinks again. This cycle allows the agent to break down complex tasks and approach them systematically.
## Flexibility and Multiple Tools: Beyond Simple RAG
A key advantage of Agentic RAG is its flexibility. While RAG on its own is a powerful tool, it's not the only one an agent can use. In fact, an agent could access a whole toolkit of different functions depending on its purpose and goal.
Warfield points out, "You can have the agent request a type of tool they might want and then get back that tool, which can be done with RAG. So not only are the tools themselves RAG, you can build a retrieval engine for retrieving tools that are described textually."
This approach allows the agent to become a flexible problem-solver, adapting its strategy based on the task at hand.
### Real-World Applications: From Medical Claims to Call Centers
The real-world applications for Agentic RAG are varied and have not yet been fully explored.
In the medical field, for example, Agentic RAG could revolutionize claim processing. Instead of a simple keyword search, a system with this tech under the hood could understand the context of a particular claim, cross-reference it with medical knowledge from a structured database, and then make nuanced decisions about its validity and take action based on its decision.
In customer service, the impact is already being felt. As noted in the podcast, "For example, call centers. There's been some call center applications that are scary good at traversing the standard call center script where you have a graph… basically they build an agent that kind of goes through and has text to speech and speech to text on top." Some of these early systems are already highly effective and can understand customer queries, retrieve relevant information, and navigate complex decision trees to provide accurate and helpful responses.
As the technology advances and techniques in both Agentic AI and RAG improve, it’s likely we’ll see more and more complex approaches spread through different industries over time.
### Performance Metrics and Evaluation
When implementing Agentic RAG systems, it's crucial to put evaluation metrics in place and accurately track them. These are a few example key indicators an evaluation might include:
**1**. **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks the agent successfully completes based on a specific rubric or success scale.
**2. Decision Accuracy**: How often the agent makes the correct decision or provides accurate information.
**3. Response Time**: The time taken to complete a task or provide a response.
**4. Tool Usage Efficiency:** How effectively the agent uses its available tools.
### Challenges and Considerations: The Hallucination Problem
Agentic RAG has its potential challenges and pitfalls, as with any sophisticated AI system. One of the most significant issues is hallucination - when AI systems generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
This problem gets amplified in Agentic systems due to their complexity and the number of potential variables that could go awry. If one part of the system starts to hallucinate, it may cause the agents to experience a sort of shared hallucination that poses risks for reliability as the clip below describes.
When it comes to verifying the outputs and functionality of an Agentic RAG system, there are a number of challenges to consider. Verifying a system at each step of the process can quickly become unwieldy as the system grows in complexity.
As Warfield notes in the below clip, "The verification process of an agentic system is the same as the verification of RAG, but way harder because now it's also wrapped around an agent. So you can still have the core RAG that fails, and then you can also have the agent that fails, and it can fail in terms of how it thinks, in how it structures the tool execution...it can snowball really quickly."
While there is no silver bullet for a perfect Agentic system, the following strategies could help to mitigate hallucinations:
1. **Fact-checking:** Cross-reference generated information with trusted sources.
2. **Confidence scoring:** Implement a system where the agent rates its confidence in its outputs.
3. **Human-in-the-loop validation**: For critical applications, include human oversight to verify important decisions.
### Integration with Existing Systems
Integrating Agentic RAG into existing systems has a lot of potential, but requires careful architectural planning.
Here's one high-level approach:
1. **Define **clear APIs for communication between the Agentic RAG system and existing components.
2. **Build **a robust data pipeline to feed relevant information into the RAG knowledge base.
3. **Design **a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the agent's performance based on real-world interactions.
4. **Implement **proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for when the agent fails or produces low-confidence results.
### Conclusion
As we look to the future of Agentic RAG, it's clear that it’s a powerful but complex technology.
The episode closes with an apt analogy: "What do we do with this crazy fast car we just got? Maybe in the next episode Daniel tries to figure out how to drive AI without crashing the car."
This describes the current state of Agentic RAG - we have a powerful vehicle, but we're still learning how to drive it safely. The technology may be production-ready in some areas, especially where the problem space is well-defined like for some call center applications. However, for more open-ended or critical applications, careful design and testing are crucial.
As developers, our challenge is to harness the power of Agentic RAG while managing its complexities. This involves not just understanding the technical aspects of implementation and integration, but also tackling issues of reliability, user experience, and more.
The potential for Agentic RAG is huge. It could be the backbone for AI systems that are more flexible, more capable, and better able to handle complex, multi-step tasks. But realizing this potential in production-ready applications will require ongoing research, careful implementation and testing, and a deep understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of these systems.

 # Deep Dive into Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (A-RAG)
## Overview
Most of us are now familiar with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It starts off with a query input into a RAG pipeline which does retrieval, reranking, synthesis and gets back a response.
Beyond the above naive implementation there are many flavours of RAG that address specific requirements for improving the efficiency and accuracy of response generation. In this article we will not be delving in to RAG architectures per se, but will talk about why, how and what of making RAG more agentic.
Jerry Liu, LlamaIndex co-founder/CEO delivered an excellent keynote on Beyond Naive RAG: Adding Agentic Layers. In this article we will do a deep dive of the agentic RAG concepts (with code implementations). This is necessary for one to go from concepts to learning to implementation. This article brings together most of the knowledge base in to one coherent whole and has been collated from diverse sources of information. Not the least being LlamaIndex's documentation itself. One more point to note is that I implemented agentic RAG using LlamaIndex as it has the best abstractions for RAG. However the principles described here can be used to implement Agentic RAG from scratch in any other framework.
## Why of Agentic RAG
An AI Agent is required when we use reasoning to determine which action(s) to take and in which order to take them. Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!!!
Agency : The ability to take action or to choose what action to take
In the context of RAG, we can plug in agents to enhance the reasoning prior to selection of RAG pipelines, within a RAG pipeline for retrieval or reranking and finally for synthesising before we send out the response. This improves RAG to a large extent by automating complex workflows and decisions that are required for a non trivial RAG use case.
## How of Agentic RAG
Usage patterns for Agents in a RAG context comprises of the following:
-- Use an existing RAG pipeline as a tool by an agent
-- Use an agent itself as a RAG tool
-- Use an agent to retrieve tools from a RAG (Vector index) at query time using a provided context.
-- Use an agent to do query planning over a set of existing tools
-- Use an agent to select a tool from candidate tools which have been retrieved from a pool of tools using RAG.(This is especially useful when we have a large set of tools to select from)
One can also mix and match the above usage patterns to realise a complex RAG application.
RAG Agents can be further classified based on function. They can be used for routing, one-shot query planning, tool use, reason + act (ReAct) and dynamic planning and execution. These range from simple, low cost and low latency to complex, high cost and high latency.
### Routing Agent
Routing agent essentially uses an LLM to pick what downstream RAG pipeline to pick. This is agentic reasoning as it uses an LLM to reason about what RAG pipeline to pick based on the input query. This is the simplest form of agentic reasoning.
Another class of routing is to select between Summarization and Question Answering RAG pipelines. Based on the input query the agent reasons about routing to the Summary query engine or the Vector Query Engine that are configured as tools.
### One-Shot Query Planning Agent
Query Planning agent breaks down a complex query in to parallelizable sub queries. Each sub query can then possibly executed against a set of RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The resulting responses from each RAG pipeline is then synthesised in to the final response. Essentially in query planning, the first step is to decompose into sub queries, then execute each sub query against appropriate RAG pipeline (data sources). Once the results of the sub queries are generated, they are synthesized in to a final response.
### Tool Use Agent
In standard RAG, a query is just passed in to get the top k documents semantically matching the query. However there are times when we need to get data from an external API, a SQL Database or an application that exposes an API, which can then be used as additional context to the input query before sending it to the LLM. In such scenarios the agent can use a RAG toolspec.
### ReAct Agent
ReAct : Reason + Act with LLMs
The next step up is to add some sort of reasoning and actions which are executed in a loop over a complex query. Essentially it is a superset of Routing, Query Planning and Tool Use all rolled in to one. A ReAct agent can handle sequential multi part query and keep state (in memory). (See the ReAct paper here)
ReAct Agent has the following logic:
## Recommended by LinkedIn
### Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent
ReAct is by far the most popular agent so far. However there is a need for handling user intent that is more complex. Also more and more agents are deployed in production settings that require higher reliability, observability, parallelization, control and separation of concerns. Essentially we need long term planning, execution insight, efficiency, optimization and reduce latency.
Two papers have been published in the recent past that address this:
At a high level these attempt to separate the higher level planning from short term execution. The logic for such agents is:
So we would need a planner and a executor. The planner most likely will be using an LLM to take the user query and generate a step by step plan. The executor can then take each step and figure out which tools if any are required to complete the task defined in the step. This process continues until the whole plan is executed and the final response is shown.
Langchain has a Plan and Execute agent (still experimental). Llama Index has a Llama pack for LLMCompiler
### ReAct Vs LLMCompiler
This is at the bleeding edge of development and more improvements in this can be expected. Some areas which can be further improved from the current State of the Art (SOTA) are:
## What of Agentic RAG
Here is a link to a google colab notebook where I implemented Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation using LlamaIndex. It has code examples demonstrating all the above agents and roughly follows the sections as laid out in this article.
I used 2023 SEC 10K filings from ExpediaGroup, Booking (dot) com, Uber and Lyft as the main datasets. I have provided links in the notebook on where to download this data from.
Dataset
I have mainly used LlamaIndex V 0.10.15. Used Langchain's PlanAndExecute with LlamaIndex query engine tools that have been wrapped to work with Langchain. This is interesting in that now we can use LlamaIndex RAG tools within Langchain.

 Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized our interaction with information. However, their dependence on internal knowledge alone can limit the accuracy and depth of their responses, especially for complex queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enabling LLMs to access and process information from external sources, resulting in more grounded and informative answers.
While standard RAG excels at handling simple queries across a few documents, agentic RAG takes it a step further and emerges as a formidable solution for question answering. The key differentiator of agentic RAG is the introduction of AI agents. These agents act as autonomous decision-makers, analyzing initial findings and strategically selecting the most effective tools for further data retrieval. This multi-step reasoning capability empowers agentic RAG to tackle intricate research tasks, such as summarizing, comparing information across multiple documents, and even formulating follow-up questions – all in an organized and efficient manner. This newfound agency transforms the LLM from a passive responder to an active investigator, capable of delving deep into complex information and delivering comprehensive, well-reasoned answers. agentic RAG holds immense potential for applications such as research, data analysis, and knowledge exploration.
Agentic RAG represents a significant leap forward in the field of AI-powered research assistants and virtual assistants. Its ability to reason, adapt, and leverage external knowledge paves the way for a new generation of intelligent agents that can significantly enhance our ability to interact with and analyze information.
In this article, we will delve into agentic RAG, exploring its inner workings, applications, and benefits for users. We will unpack the concept of agentic RAG, its key differences from traditional Agentic RAG types, the integration of agents into the RAG framework, their functionality within the framework, implementation strategies, real-world use cases, and finally, the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
**Recent Developments With LLM And RAG**
The recent developments in information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), particularly with LLM and RAG, have ushered in a transformative era of efficiency and sophistication. These advancements have made significant strides in four key areas:
**1. Enhanced Retrieval:**
Optimizing information retrieval within RAG systems is pivotal for performance. Recent breakthroughs focus on developing reranking algorithms and hybrid search methodologies to enhance search precision. By employing multiple vectors for each document, a granular content representation is achieved, allowing for improved relevance identification.
**2. Semantic Caching:**
To minimize computational costs and ensure response consistency, semantic caching has emerged as a key strategy. It involves storing answers to recent queries along with their semantic context. This enables similar requests to be efficiently addressed without repeated LLM calls, facilitating faster response times and consistent information delivery.

This goes beyond text-based LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, integrating images and other modalities. It facilitates access to a wider range of source materials and enables seamless interactions between textual and visual data. This leads to more comprehensive and nuanced responses.
These advancements set the stage for further exploration into the complexities of agentic RAG, which will be delved into in detail in the forthcoming sections.
These advances pave the way for captivating explorations of agentic RAG, which will be comprehensively examined in subsequent sections.
**What Is Agentic RAG?**
Agentic RAG (Agent-based RAG implementation) revolutionizes question answering through an innovative agent-based framework. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on large language models (LLMs), agentic RAG employs intelligent agents to adeptly tackle complex questions. These agents act as skilled researchers, navigating multiple documents, synthesizing information, and providing comprehensive and accurate answers. The implementation of agentic RAG is scalable, allowing the addition of new documents managed by their sub-agents.

It leverages the collaborative intelligence of diverse agents to conquer intricate knowledge hurdles. Through its capabilities for planning, reasoning, employing tools, and ongoing learning, agentic RAG transforms the pursuit of comprehensive and accurate knowledge acquisition.
**Differences Between Agentic RAG And Traditional RAG**
By comparing agentic RAG and traditional RAG, we can gain valuable insights into the evolution of retrieval-augmented generation systems. In this article, we will focus on the key features that distinguish agentic RAG from its traditional counterpart, highlighting the advancements it brings.
**Traditional RAG:**
- Heavy reliance on manual prompt engineering and optimization techniques.
- Limited contextual awareness and static retrieval decision-making processes.
- Unoptimized retrievals and additional text generation result in unnecessary costs.
- Requires additional classifiers and models for multi-step reasoning and tool usage.
- Static rules governing retrieval and response generation, limit flexibility and adaptability.
- Sole reliance on the initial query for document retrieval, hinders the handling of evolving or new information.
- Limited ability to adapt to changing situations or incorporate new information.
**Agentic RAG:**
- Dynamically adjust prompts based on context and goals, reducing manual prompt engineering.
- Consider conversation history and adapt retrieval strategies based on context.
- Optimize retrievals, minimize unnecessary text generation, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.
- Handle multi-step reasoning and tool usage, eliminating the need for separate classifiers and models.
- Determine when and where to retrieve information, evaluate data quality, and perform post-generation checks on responses.
- Perform actions in the environment to gather additional information before or during retrieval.
- Adjust its approach based on feedback and real-time observations.
The distinct capabilities of agentic RAG highlight its potential to revolutionize information retrieval. By enabling AI systems to actively interact with and explore intricate environments, agentic RAG empowers these systems to engage more effectively with their surroundings. This leads to improved decision-making and efficient task completion through enhanced information retrieval capabilities.
**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

 # Leveraging the Evolution of RAG in Enterprise Applications with Agentic RAG and Graph RAG
About a year ago, I shared my thoughts here on LinkedIn about a concept that the AI community calls "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG). ("Leveraging Generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Data" and "Unlocking the Potential of AI with Vector Databases and Embeddings").
Meanwhile, after 12 months, a lot has changed, the landscape has evolved significantly with the introduction of advanced strategies such as Agentic RAG and Graph RAG, and I think it's time for an update and a revised view that I want to share with you with this post.
If you have 10 minutes, let's look at how the initial RAG concept has evolved and why, and how the use of dynamic agents and graph relationships address the limitations of the basic RAG idea. And most importantly, what this means for business and enterprise applications and potential use case scenarios.
### Understanding the Limitations of Initial and Naive RAG Implementations
When I first looked into the RAG concept last year, it was in the context of building a customer-facing product recommendation system for one of our clients. The system was based on semantic analysis and deep product knowledge, to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses to user queries with the help of GenAI.
How to balance privacy and compliance concerns with measurable customer benefits while leveraging technologies like Generative AI has turned out to be quite a challenge. But that is for another post, how LLMOps and frameworks like ragas and Langfuse (YC W23) and concepts like "LLM as judge" can help.
Reminder #1: RAG works by retrieving relevant documents from a large set of (usually private) data and using these documents to guide the generation process of large language models (LLMs). The basic idea is to overcome the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as their tendency to generate factually inaccurate or irrelevant information.
Reminder #2: LLMs are like first-day interns: Smart and eager but know nothing about the person or company they’re working for. However, when an LLM has the required context, it will be able to provide meaningful answers.
Reminder #3: LLMs can act on data they've never seen before.
So much for the bare concept and initial idea; and it quickly turned out that the crucial part of "Retrieval Augmented Generation" is the "Retrieval" part and that there are some limitations associated to that.
The main limitation is that RAG relies heavily on semantic search for context retrieval. If you are interested in how this works and what role vector databases and embeddings play in this context, please read my post "Unlocking the Potential of AI with Vector Databases and Embeddings".
While this method is very impressive and can be effective to a degree, it often struggles to understand the deeper relationships between entities within the data which can lead to less accurate or contextually appropriate answers, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries that require a nuanced understanding of interrelated data points or when the task is to compare products or contents.
It's also relatively static, which means that this process lacks the ability to adapt dynamically to new contexts which can lead to suboptimal retrieval, especially in rapidly changing environments.
Integrating RAG with existing data silos which you usually see in enterprises and ensuring seamless access to various data sets can also be quite challenging, which results in incomplete and/or biased retrieval.
And then there's the critical issue of scalability as data volumes grow. The efficiency and speed of the retrieval process can decrease significantly, which makes it less practical for large-scale enterprise applications.
Realizing these limitations, the industry and researchers have meanwhile been working on more sophisticated approaches to improve the performance and applicability of RAG systems especially the retrieval step(s).
Let's look briefly into the two most promising (at least from my PoV) recent developments: Agentic RAG and Graph RAG.
### Agentic RAG: Extending RAG with Dynamic Agents
One of the most significant advances in RAG is Agentic RAG.
As the name suggests, Agentic RAG incorporates dynamic agents who are capable to execute specialized tasks in combination with dynamic prompt engineering and adaptive retrieval strategies.
Agents are designed to dynamically query databases, interpret results, dynamically search the Web, or query other sources. They clearly stand out by their advanced abilities to plan and reflect, consider context information, and utilize a wide range of tools.
In general, multi-agent systems represent a significant advancement over deterministic solutions, enabling the automation of more complex business processes.
If you want to dig deeper into this broader topic, I highly recommend taking some time to look at this presentation by my dear colleague André Koriath on how and where agent systems are particularly useful in a wider business and enterprise context.
Back to AgenticRAG: Imagine you're a detective working on a complex case. Instead of working alone, you have a team of specialized detectives (agents). One detective might focus on witness interviews, another on forensic evidence, and another on digital footprint analysis. They constantly share their findings with each other and refine their approach as new information emerges. This collaborative and adaptive approach allows for a more complete understanding of the case and ultimately leads to more accurate and insightful conclusions. And this is exactly how AgenticRAG works: It uses dynamic agents to continuously improve the accuracy and relevance of the information it retrieves and processes.
AgenticRAG is highly dynamic and supports goal-driven task execution which is significantly different compared to traditional RAG systems.
Good examples of typical agents are database query agents, document parsing agents that extract key insights from different documents, and real-time monitoring agents to update context but also to search the web.
Frameworks like the Llama-Agents framework (by LlamaIndex ) even support the creation of asynchronous agents and provide tools to deploy them as autonomous microservices, which can be of significant help when building highly modular and scalable systems.
### Graph RAG: Leveraging Graph-Based Relationships
Graph RAG, recently introduced by Microsoft , on the other hand, addresses some of the weaknesses of Baseline RAG in a very different way. The key idea is to also integrate graph-based data structures during the retrieval process and to utilize the relationships between certain entities.
This method goes way beyond basic semantic search and maps entities that are related, which leads to a richer and more contextually accurate data set for the LLM.
Imagine a library where books are not only organized by genre or author, but also connected by thematic threads, references, and common concepts. Now imagine a librarian (Graph RAG) who can not only find books directly related to the question or request of the person who entered the library, but also uncover connections to other relevant materials, leading to a deeper and richer understanding of the topic, which is handed over to a storyteller (LLM) to answer the original question in plain English.
### Differences and potential business applications
Now let's briefly compare both concepts to each other.
While both Agentic RAG and Graph RAG aim to improve and enhance the initial RAG process, they focus on very different aspects.
AgenticRAG provides dynamic and specialized task execution, making it ideal for environments where real-time, context-specific data retrieval is critical. This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where immediate and accurate responses are required, such as customer support or financial analysis.
On the other hand, Graph RAG is unique in its ability to understand and exploit complex data relationships. By mapping the intricate connections between data points, Graph RAG can provide way deeper and more contextual answers. This makes it invaluable for applications that require deep contextual insights, such as knowledge management and research and development.
### Conclusion
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) came to stay, it's (still) an amazing concept.
The evolution from initial RAG to advanced concepts like Agentic RAG and Graph RAG marks a significant leap in how we can leverage generative AI for enterprise applications in a secure and compliant way.
By overcoming the limitations of early RAG implementations, these new strategies deliver much more accurate, contextually relevant, and actionable insights, and provide a great foundation for many applications that help businesses transform the way they operate, make decisions, and create real customer value.

 **Building an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with IBM Watsonx and Langchain**
## A quick-start tutorial
The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in Generative AI, has seen significant advancements recently. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been truly transformative in this regard. One popular approach to building an LLM application is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines the ability to leverage an organization’s data with the generative capabilities of these LLMs. Agents are a popular and useful way to introduce autonomous behaviour into LLM applications.
**What is Agentic RAG?**
Agentic RAG represents an advanced evolution in AI systems, *where autonomous agents utilize RAG techniques to enhance their decision-making and response abilities*. Unlike traditional RAG models, which often rely on user input to trigger actions, agentic RAG systems adopt a proactive approach. These agents autonomously seek out relevant information, analyse it and use it to generate responses or take specific actions. An agent is equipped with a set of *tools* and *can judiciously select and use the appropriate tools for the given problem.*
This proactive behaviour is particularly valuable in many use cases such as customer service, research assistance, and complex problem-solving scenarios. By integrating the generative capability of LLMs with advanced retrieval systems agentic RAG offers a much more effective AI solution.
**Key Features of RAG Using Agents**
**1.Task Decomposition**:
Agents can break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, handling retrieval and generation step-by-step. This approach enhances the coherence and relevance of the final output.
**2. Contextual Awareness**:
RAG agents maintain contextual awareness throughout interactions, ensuring that retrieved information aligns with the ongoing conversation or task. This leads to more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
**3. Flexible Retrieval Strategies**:
Agents can adapt their retrieval strategies based on the context, such as switching between dense and sparse retrieval or employing hybrid approaches. This optimization balances relevance and speed.
**4. Feedback Loops**:
Agents often incorporate mechanisms to use user feedback for refining future retrievals and generations, which is crucial for applications that require continuous learning and adaptation.
**5. Multi-Modal Capabilities**:
Advanced RAG agents are starting to support multi-modal capabilities, handling and generating content across various media types (text, images, videos). This versatility is useful for diverse use cases.
**6. Scalability**:
The agent architecture enables RAG systems to scale efficiently, managing large-scale retrievals while maintaining content quality, making them suitable for enterprise-level applications.
**7.Explainability**:
Some RAG agents are designed to provide explanations for their decisions, particularly in high-stakes applications, enhancing trust and transparency in the system’s outputs.
This blog post is a getting-started tutorial which guides the user through building an agentic RAG system using **Langchain** with **IBM Watsonx.ai** (both for embedding and generative capabilities) and **Milvus** vector database service provided through **IBM Watsonx.data** (for storing the vectorized knowledge chunks). For this tutorial, we have created a ReAct agent.
**Step 1: Package installation**
Let us first install the necessary Python packages. These include Langchain, IBM Watson integrations, milvus integration packages, and BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping.
`%pip install langchain`
%pip install langchain_ibm
%pip install BeautifulSoup4
%pip install langchain_community
%pip install langgraph
%pip install pymilvus
%pip install langchain_milvus
**Step 2: Imports**
Next we import the required libraries to set up the environment and configure our LLM.
`import bs4`
from Langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool
from Langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from Langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory
from Langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from Langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
from pymilvus import MilvusClient, DataType
import os, re
Here, we are importing modules for web scraping, chat history, text splitting, and vector storage (milvus)
**Step 3: Configuring environment variables**
We need to set up environment variables for IBM Watsonx, which will be used to access the LLM which is provided by Watsonx.ai
`os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = "<Your_API_Key>"`
os.environ["PROJECT_ID"] = "<Your_Project_ID>"
os.environ["GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER"] = "<Your_DNS_Resolver>"
Please make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
**Step 4: Initializing Watsonx LLM**
With the environment set up, we initialize the IBM Watsonx LLM with specific parameters to control the generation process. We are using the ChatWatsonx class here with ** mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01** model from watsonx.ai.
`from Langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx`
llm = ChatWatsonx(
model_id="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01",
url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
project_id=os.getenv("PROJECT_ID"),
params={
"decoding_method": "sample",
"max_new_tokens": 5879,
"min_new_tokens": 2,
"temperature": 0,
"top_k": 50,
"top_p": 1,
}
)
This configuration sets up the LLM for text generation. We can tweak the inference parameters here for generating desired responses. More information about model inference parameters and their permissible values here
**Step 5: Loading and splitting documents**
We load the documents from a web page and split them into chunks to facilitate efficient retrieval. The chunks generated are stored in the milvus instance that we have provisioned.
`loader = WebBaseLoader(`
web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
bs_kwargs=dict(
parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
)
),
)
docs = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1500, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
This code scrapes content from a specified web page, then splits the content into smaller segments, which will later be indexed for retrieval.
**Disclaimer:** We have confirmed that this site allows scraping, but it’s important to always double-check the site’s permissions before scraping. Websites can update their policies, so ensure your actions comply with their terms of use and relevant laws.
**Step 6: Setting up the retriever**
We establish a connection to Milvus to store the document embeddings and enable fast retrieval.
`from AdpativeClient import InMemoryMilvusStrategy, RemoteMilvusStrategy, BasicRAGHandler`
def adapt(number_of_files=0, total_file_size=0, data_size_in_kbs=0.0):
strategy = InMemoryMilvusStrategy()
if(number_of_files > 10 or total_file_size > 10 or data_size_in_kbs > 0.25):
strategy = RemoteMilvusStrategy()
client = strategy.connect()
return client
client = adapt(total_size_kb)
handler = BasicRAGHandler(client)
retriever = handler.create_index(splits)
This function decides whether to use an in-memory or remote Milvus instance based on the size of the data, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
BasicRAGHandler class covers the following functionalities at a high level:
· Initializes the handler with a Milvus client, allowing interaction with the Milvus vector database provisioned through IBM Watsonx.data
· Generates document embeddings, defines a schema, and creates an index in Milvus for efficient retrieval.
· Inserts document, their embeddings and metadata into a collection in Milvus.
**Step 7: Defining the tools**
With the retrieval system set up, we now define retriever as a tool . This tool will be used by the LLM to perform context-based information retrieval
`tool = create_retriever_tool(`
retriever,
"blog_post_retriever",
"Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",

Through harnessing these patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
## How to implement agentic RAG?

 **Building an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with IBM Watsonx and Langchain**
## A quick-start tutorial
The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in Generative AI, has seen significant advancements recently. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been truly transformative in this regard. One popular approach to building an LLM application is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines the ability to leverage an organization’s data with the generative capabilities of these LLMs. Agents are a popular and useful way to introduce autonomous behaviour into LLM applications.
**What is Agentic RAG?**
Agentic RAG represents an advanced evolution in AI systems, *where autonomous agents utilize RAG techniques to enhance their decision-making and response abilities*. Unlike traditional RAG models, which often rely on user input to trigger actions, agentic RAG systems adopt a proactive approach. These agents autonomously seek out relevant information, analyse it and use it to generate responses or take specific actions. An agent is equipped with a set of *tools* and *can judiciously select and use the appropriate tools for the given problem.*
This proactive behaviour is particularly valuable in many use cases such as customer service, research assistance, and complex problem-solving scenarios. By integrating the generative capability of LLMs with advanced retrieval systems agentic RAG offers a much more effective AI solution.
**Key Features of RAG Using Agents**
**1.Task Decomposition**:
Agents can break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, handling retrieval and generation step-by-step. This approach enhances the coherence and relevance of the final output.
**2. Contextual Awareness**:

**7.Explainability**:
Some RAG agents are designed to provide explanations for their decisions, particularly in high-stakes applications, enhancing trust and transparency in the system’s outputs.
This blog post is a getting-started tutorial which guides the user through building an agentic RAG system using **Langchain** with **IBM Watsonx.ai** (both for embedding and generative capabilities) and **Milvus** vector database service provided through **IBM Watsonx.data** (for storing the vectorized knowledge chunks). For this tutorial, we have created a ReAct agent.
**Step 1: Package installation**
Let us first install the necessary Python packages. These include Langchain, IBM Watson integrations, milvus integration packages, and BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping.
`%pip install langchain`
%pip install langchain_ibm
%pip install BeautifulSoup4
%pip install langchain_community
%pip install langgraph
%pip install pymilvus
%pip install langchain_milvus
**Step 2: Imports**
Next we import the required libraries to set up the environment and configure our LLM.
`import bs4`
from Langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool
from Langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from Langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory
from Langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from Langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
from pymilvus import MilvusClient, DataType
import os, re
Here, we are importing modules for web scraping, chat history, text splitting, and vector storage (milvus)
**Step 3: Configuring environment variables**
We need to set up environment variables for IBM Watsonx, which will be used to access the LLM which is provided by Watsonx.ai
`os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = "<Your_API_Key>"`
os.environ["PROJECT_ID"] = "<Your_Project_ID>"
os.environ["GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER"] = "<Your_DNS_Resolver>"
Please make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
**Step 4: Initializing Watsonx LLM**
With the environment set up, we initialize the IBM Watsonx LLM with specific parameters to control the generation process. We are using the ChatWatsonx class here with ** mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01** model from watsonx.ai.
`from Langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx`
llm = ChatWatsonx(
model_id="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01",
url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
project_id=os.getenv("PROJECT_ID"),
params={
"decoding_method": "sample",
"max_new_tokens": 5879,
"min_new_tokens": 2,
"temperature": 0,
"top_k": 50,
"top_p": 1,
}
)
This configuration sets up the LLM for text generation. We can tweak the inference parameters here for generating desired responses. More information about model inference parameters and their permissible values here
**Step 5: Loading and splitting documents**
We load the documents from a web page and split them into chunks to facilitate efficient retrieval. The chunks generated are stored in the milvus instance that we have provisioned.
`loader = WebBaseLoader(`
web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
bs_kwargs=dict(
parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
)
),
)
docs = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1500, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
This code scrapes content from a specified web page, then splits the content into smaller segments, which will later be indexed for retrieval.
**Disclaimer:** We have confirmed that this site allows scraping, but it’s important to always double-check the site’s permissions before scraping. Websites can update their policies, so ensure your actions comply with their terms of use and relevant laws.
**Step 6: Setting up the retriever**
We establish a connection to Milvus to store the document embeddings and enable fast retrieval.
`from AdpativeClient import InMemoryMilvusStrategy, RemoteMilvusStrategy, BasicRAGHandler`
def adapt(number_of_files=0, total_file_size=0, data_size_in_kbs=0.0):
strategy = InMemoryMilvusStrategy()
if(number_of_files > 10 or total_file_size > 10 or data_size_in_kbs > 0.25):
strategy = RemoteMilvusStrategy()
client = strategy.connect()
return client
client = adapt(total_size_kb)
handler = BasicRAGHandler(client)
retriever = handler.create_index(splits)
This function decides whether to use an in-memory or remote Milvus instance based on the size of the data, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
BasicRAGHandler class covers the following functionalities at a high level:
· Initializes the handler with a Milvus client, allowing interaction with the Milvus vector database provisioned through IBM Watsonx.data
· Generates document embeddings, defines a schema, and creates an index in Milvus for efficient retrieval.
· Inserts document, their embeddings and metadata into a collection in Milvus.
**Step 7: Defining the tools**
With the retrieval system set up, we now define retriever as a tool . This tool will be used by the LLM to perform context-based information retrieval
`tool = create_retriever_tool(`
retriever,
"blog_post_retriever",
"Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
)
tools = [tool]
**Step 8: Generating responses**
Finally, we can now generate responses to user queries, leveraging the retrieved content.
`from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent`
from Langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
response = agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is ReAct?")]})
raw_content = response["messages"][1].content
In this tutorial (link to code), we have demonstrated how to build a sample Agentic RAG system using Langchain and IBM Watsonx. Agentic RAG systems mark a significant advancement in AI, combining the generative power of LLMs with the precision of sophisticated retrieval techniques. Their ability to autonomously provide contextually relevant and accurate information makes them increasingly valuable across various domains.
As the demand for more intelligent and interactive AI solutions continues to rise, mastering the integration of LLMs with retrieval tools will be essential. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of AI responses but also creates a more dynamic and user-centric interaction, paving the way for the next generation of AI-powered applications.

Through harnessing these patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

 **Building an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with IBM Watsonx and Langchain**
## A quick-start tutorial
The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in Generative AI, has seen significant advancements recently. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been truly transformative in this regard. One popular approach to building an LLM application is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines the ability to leverage an organization’s data with the generative capabilities of these LLMs. Agents are a popular and useful way to introduce autonomous behaviour into LLM applications.
**What is Agentic RAG?**
Agentic RAG represents an advanced evolution in AI systems, *where autonomous agents utilize RAG techniques to enhance their decision-making and response abilities*. Unlike traditional RAG models, which often rely on user input to trigger actions, agentic RAG systems adopt a proactive approach. These agents autonomously seek out relevant information, analyse it and use it to generate responses or take specific actions. An agent is equipped with a set of *tools* and *can judiciously select and use the appropriate tools for the given problem.*
This proactive behaviour is particularly valuable in many use cases such as customer service, research assistance, and complex problem-solving scenarios. By integrating the generative capability of LLMs with advanced retrieval systems agentic RAG offers a much more effective AI solution.
**Key Features of RAG Using Agents**
**1.Task Decomposition**:
Agents can break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, handling retrieval and generation step-by-step. This approach enhances the coherence and relevance of the final output.
**2. Contextual Awareness**:
RAG agents maintain contextual awareness throughout interactions, ensuring that retrieved information aligns with the ongoing conversation or task. This leads to more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
**3. Flexible Retrieval Strategies**:
Agents can adapt their retrieval strategies based on the context, such as switching between dense and sparse retrieval or employing hybrid approaches. This optimization balances relevance and speed.
**4. Feedback Loops**:
Agents often incorporate mechanisms to use user feedback for refining future retrievals and generations, which is crucial for applications that require continuous learning and adaptation.
**5. Multi-Modal Capabilities**:
Advanced RAG agents are starting to support multi-modal capabilities, handling and generating content across various media types (text, images, videos). This versatility is useful for diverse use cases.
**6. Scalability**:
The agent architecture enables RAG systems to scale efficiently, managing large-scale retrievals while maintaining content quality, making them suitable for enterprise-level applications.
**7.Explainability**:
Some RAG agents are designed to provide explanations for their decisions, particularly in high-stakes applications, enhancing trust and transparency in the system’s outputs.
This blog post is a getting-started tutorial which guides the user through building an agentic RAG system using **Langchain** with **IBM Watsonx.ai** (both for embedding and generative capabilities) and **Milvus** vector database service provided through **IBM Watsonx.data** (for storing the vectorized knowledge chunks). For this tutorial, we have created a ReAct agent.
**Step 1: Package installation**
Let us first install the necessary Python packages. These include Langchain, IBM Watson integrations, milvus integration packages, and BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping.
`%pip install langchain`
%pip install langchain_ibm
%pip install BeautifulSoup4
%pip install langchain_community
%pip install langgraph
%pip install pymilvus
%pip install langchain_milvus
**Step 2: Imports**
Next we import the required libraries to set up the environment and configure our LLM.
`import bs4`
from Langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool
from Langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from Langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory
from Langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from Langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
from pymilvus import MilvusClient, DataType
import os, re
Here, we are importing modules for web scraping, chat history, text splitting, and vector storage (milvus)
**Step 3: Configuring environment variables**
We need to set up environment variables for IBM Watsonx, which will be used to access the LLM which is provided by Watsonx.ai
`os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = "<Your_API_Key>"`
os.environ["PROJECT_ID"] = "<Your_Project_ID>"
os.environ["GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER"] = "<Your_DNS_Resolver>"
Please make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
**Step 4: Initializing Watsonx LLM**
With the environment set up, we initialize the IBM Watsonx LLM with specific parameters to control the generation process. We are using the ChatWatsonx class here with ** mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01** model from watsonx.ai.
`from Langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx`
llm = ChatWatsonx(
model_id="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01",
url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
project_id=os.getenv("PROJECT_ID"),
params={
"decoding_method": "sample",
"max_new_tokens": 5879,
"min_new_tokens": 2,
"temperature": 0,
"top_k": 50,
"top_p": 1,
}
)
This configuration sets up the LLM for text generation. We can tweak the inference parameters here for generating desired responses. More information about model inference parameters and their permissible values here
**Step 5: Loading and splitting documents**
We load the documents from a web page and split them into chunks to facilitate efficient retrieval. The chunks generated are stored in the milvus instance that we have provisioned.
`loader = WebBaseLoader(`
web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
bs_kwargs=dict(
parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
)
),
)
docs = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1500, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
This code scrapes content from a specified web page, then splits the content into smaller segments, which will later be indexed for retrieval.
**Disclaimer:** We have confirmed that this site allows scraping, but it’s important to always double-check the site’s permissions before scraping. Websites can update their policies, so ensure your actions comply with their terms of use and relevant laws.
**Step 6: Setting up the retriever**
We establish a connection to Milvus to store the document embeddings and enable fast retrieval.
`from AdpativeClient import InMemoryMilvusStrategy, RemoteMilvusStrategy, BasicRAGHandler`
def adapt(number_of_files=0, total_file_size=0, data_size_in_kbs=0.0):
strategy = InMemoryMilvusStrategy()
if(number_of_files > 10 or total_file_size > 10 or data_size_in_kbs > 0.25):
strategy = RemoteMilvusStrategy()
client = strategy.connect()
return client
client = adapt(total_size_kb)
handler = BasicRAGHandler(client)
retriever = handler.create_index(splits)
This function decides whether to use an in-memory or remote Milvus instance based on the size of the data, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
BasicRAGHandler class covers the following functionalities at a high level:
· Initializes the handler with a Milvus client, allowing interaction with the Milvus vector database provisioned through IBM Watsonx.data
· Generates document embeddings, defines a schema, and creates an index in Milvus for efficient retrieval.
· Inserts document, their embeddings and metadata into a collection in Milvus.
**Step 7: Defining the tools**
With the retrieval system set up, we now define retriever as a tool . This tool will be used by the LLM to perform context-based information retrieval
`tool = create_retriever_tool(`
retriever,
"blog_post_retriever",
"Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
)
tools = [tool]
**Step 8: Generating responses**
Finally, we can now generate responses to user queries, leveraging the retrieved content.
`from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent`
from Langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
response = agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is ReAct?")]})
raw_content = response["messages"][1].content
In this tutorial (link to code), we have demonstrated how to build a sample Agentic RAG system using Langchain and IBM Watsonx. Agentic RAG systems mark a significant advancement in AI, combining the generative power of LLMs with the precision of sophisticated retrieval techniques. Their ability to autonomously provide contextually relevant and accurate information makes them increasingly valuable across various domains.
As the demand for more intelligent and interactive AI solutions continues to rise, mastering the integration of LLMs with retrieval tools will be essential. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of AI responses but also creates a more dynamic and user-centric interaction, paving the way for the next generation of AI-powered applications.

# Title:Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Time Series Analysis
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Time series modeling is crucial for many applications, however, it faces challenges such as complex spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution shifts in learning from historical context to predict task-specific outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for time series analysis. The framework leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where the master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents and delegates the end-user request to the relevant sub-agent. The sub-agents utilize smaller, pre-trained language models (SLMs) customized for specific time series tasks through fine-tuning using instruction tuning and direct preference optimization, and retrieve relevant prompts from a shared repository of prompt pools containing distilled knowledge about historical patterns and trends to improve predictions on new data. Our proposed modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series tasks by tackling complex challenges more effectively than task-specific customized methods across benchmark datasets.

 # Agentic RAG
Alright, let’s get straight to the meat of the matter — understanding the Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach and how it’s revolutionizing the way we handle information. Buckle up, because this is about to get wild!
At its core, **Agentic RAG **is all about injecting intelligence and autonomy into the RAG framework. It’s like giving a regular RAG system a major upgrade, transforming it into an autonomous agent capable of making its own decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Pretty cool, right?
# But what exactly does this mean in practice? Well, let me break it down for you.
**Context is King:** One of the biggest limitations of traditional RAG implementations was their inability to truly understand and factor in the broader conversational context. Agentic RAG agents, on the other hand, are designed to be context-aware. They can grasp the nuances of a dialogue, consider the history, and adapt their behavior accordingly. This means more coherent and relevant responses, as if the agent is truly engaged in a natural conversation.
**Intelligent Retrieval Strategies:** Remember how RAG systems used to rely on static rules for retrieval? Boring! Agentic RAG agents are way smarter than that. They employ intelligent retrieval strategies, dynamically assessing the user’s query, available tools (data sources), and contextual cues to determine the most appropriate retrieval action. It’s like having a personal assistant who knows exactly where to look for the information you need.
**Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Now, here’s where things get really interesting. Complex queries often span multiple documents or data sources, right? Well, in the world of Agentic RAG, we’ve got a little something called multi-agent orchestration. Imagine having multiple specialized agents, each an expert in their own domain or data source, collaborating and synthesizing their findings to provide you with a comprehensive response. It’s like having a team of experts working together to solve your toughest problems.
**Agentic Reasoning:** But wait, there’s more! Agentic RAG agents aren’t just good at retrieving information; they’re also equipped with reasoning capabilities that go way beyond simple retrieval and generation. These agents can perform evaluations, corrections, and quality checks on the retrieved data, ensuring that the output you receive is accurate and reliable. No more worrying about getting questionable information!

They can verify the truthfulness of the generated content, or even run multiple generations and select the best result for you. Talk about attention to detail!
**Adaptability and Learning:** Here’s the real kicker — Agentic RAG architectures can be designed to incorporate learning mechanisms, allowing the agents to adapt and improve their performance over time. It’s like having a system that gets smarter and more efficient the more you use it. How’s that for future-proofing?
# Agentic RAG Reference Architecture Demystified
Alright, now that we’ve got a good understanding of what Agentic RAG is all about, let’s dive into the reference architecture that makes this whole thing work.
At the heart of this architecture, we have the Agentic RAG Agent — the intelligent orchestrator that receives user queries and decides on the appropriate course of action. Think of it as the conductor of a symphony, coordinating all the different instruments (tools) to create a harmonious performance.
Now, this agent isn’t alone in its endeavors. It’s equipped with a suite of tools, each associated with a specific set of documents or data sources. These tools are like specialized agents or functions that can retrieve, process, and generate information from their respective data sources.
For example, let’s say you have Tool 1, which is responsible for accessing and processing financial statements, and Tool 2, which handles customer data. The Agentic RAG Agent can dynamically select and combine these tools based on your query, enabling it to synthesize information from multiple sources to provide you with a comprehensive response.
But wait, where does all this information come from? That’s where the documents or data sources come into play. These can be structured or unstructured, ranging from databases and knowledge bases to textual documents and multimedia content. They’re like the raw materials that the tools work with to craft the final product.
Now, let’s say you ask the agent a complex question that spans multiple domains or data sources. Here’s where the magic happens: the Agentic RAG Agent orchestrates the entire process, determining which tools to employ, retrieving relevant information from the associated data sources, and generating a final response tailored specifically to your query.
Throughout this process, the agent leverages intelligent reasoning, context awareness, and post-generation verification techniques to ensure that the output you receive is not only accurate but also tailored to your needs.
Of course, this is just a simplified representation of the reference architecture. In the real world, Agentic RAG implementations may involve additional components, such as language models, knowledge bases, and other supporting systems, depending on the specific use case and requirements.

### Result47:
 In the latest episode of the RAG Masters show, we explore Agentic RAG, different techniques to build, integrate, and evaluate it, real-world use cases, and future challenges the field might face.
## Understanding Agentic RAG: A Technical Breakdown
To leverage Agentic RAG effectively, let's first break down its core components and how they integrate.
At its core, RAG enhances language models with external knowledge. RAG fundamentally helps to augment prompting by retrieving information from a store of documents or data and then passing key pieces of information to the language model.
AI Agents, meanwhile, are systems designed to reason, act, and observe in a continuous loop. They make decisions, use tools, and adapt to new information - mimicking human problem-solving processes.
Agentic RAG combines these approaches. It creates a system that retrieves and uses information from both documents and the environment, and it can make decisions about how to use that information in a broader context. It's akin to developing a super smart assistant with a vast knowledge base and the ability to apply that knowledge to solve complex problems.
### The ReAct Architecture: Implementing the Core of Agentic Systems
The ReAct architecture (not to be confused with the JavaScript library of the same name) forms the backbone of many Agentic RAG systems. ReAct, in this context, stands for Reasoning and Act.
RAG Masters co-host Daniel Warfield describes it as "a pretty rigid structure where you ask a question, then you tell the model a few things. For example, I want you to break it into sections and every section I want you to think of something specific."
Watch the full clip for a more detailed breakdown of ReAct:
This architecture creates a cycle of thought, action, and observation. The agent thinks about what it needs to do, takes an action (which could be using a tool like RAG or making a specific API call), observes the result, and then thinks again. This cycle allows the agent to break down complex tasks and approach them systematically.
## Flexibility and Multiple Tools: Beyond Simple RAG
A key advantage of Agentic RAG is its flexibility. While RAG on its own is a powerful tool, it's not the only one an agent can use. In fact, an agent could access a whole toolkit of different functions depending on its purpose and goal.
Warfield points out, "You can have the agent request a type of tool they might want and then get back that tool, which can be done with RAG. So not only are the tools themselves RAG, you can build a retrieval engine for retrieving tools that are described textually."
This approach allows the agent to become a flexible problem-solver, adapting its strategy based on the task at hand.
### Real-World Applications: From Medical Claims to Call Centers
The real-world applications for Agentic RAG are varied and have not yet been fully explored.
In the medical field, for example, Agentic RAG could revolutionize claim processing. Instead of a simple keyword search, a system with this tech under the hood could understand the context of a particular claim, cross-reference it with medical knowledge from a structured database, and then make nuanced decisions about its validity and take action based on its decision.
In customer service, the impact is already being felt. As noted in the podcast, "For example, call centers. There's been some call center applications that are scary good at traversing the standard call center script where you have a graph… basically they build an agent that kind of goes through and has text to speech and speech to text on top." Some of these early systems are already highly effective and can understand customer queries, retrieve relevant information, and navigate complex decision trees to provide accurate and helpful responses.
As the technology advances and techniques in both Agentic AI and RAG improve, it’s likely we’ll see more and more complex approaches spread through different industries over time.
### Performance Metrics and Evaluation
When implementing Agentic RAG systems, it's crucial to put evaluation metrics in place and accurately track them. These are a few example key indicators an evaluation might include:
**1**. **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks the agent successfully completes based on a specific rubric or success scale.
**2. Decision Accuracy**: How often the agent makes the correct decision or provides accurate information.
**3. Response Time**: The time taken to complete a task or provide a response.
**4. Tool Usage Efficiency:** How effectively the agent uses its available tools.
### Challenges and Considerations: The Hallucination Problem
Agentic RAG has its potential challenges and pitfalls, as with any sophisticated AI system. One of the most significant issues is hallucination - when AI systems generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
This problem gets amplified in Agentic systems due to their complexity and the number of potential variables that could go awry. If one part of the system starts to hallucinate, it may cause the agents to experience a sort of shared hallucination that poses risks for reliability as the clip below describes.
When it comes to verifying the outputs and functionality of an Agentic RAG system, there are a number of challenges to consider. Verifying a system at each step of the process can quickly become unwieldy as the system grows in complexity.
As Warfield notes in the below clip, "The verification process of an agentic system is the same as the verification of RAG, but way harder because now it's also wrapped around an agent. So you can still have the core RAG that fails, and then you can also have the agent that fails, and it can fail in terms of how it thinks, in how it structures the tool execution...it can snowball really quickly."
While there is no silver bullet for a perfect Agentic system, the following strategies could help to mitigate hallucinations:
1. **Fact-checking:** Cross-reference generated information with trusted sources.
2. **Confidence scoring:** Implement a system where the agent rates its confidence in its outputs.
3. **Human-in-the-loop validation**: For critical applications, include human oversight to verify important decisions.
### Integration with Existing Systems
Integrating Agentic RAG into existing systems has a lot of potential, but requires careful architectural planning.
Here's one high-level approach:
1. **Define **clear APIs for communication between the Agentic RAG system and existing components.
2. **Build **a robust data pipeline to feed relevant information into the RAG knowledge base.
3. **Design **a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the agent's performance based on real-world interactions.
4. **Implement **proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for when the agent fails or produces low-confidence results.
### Conclusion
As we look to the future of Agentic RAG, it's clear that it’s a powerful but complex technology.
The episode closes with an apt analogy: "What do we do with this crazy fast car we just got? Maybe in the next episode Daniel tries to figure out how to drive AI without crashing the car."
This describes the current state of Agentic RAG - we have a powerful vehicle, but we're still learning how to drive it safely. The technology may be production-ready in some areas, especially where the problem space is well-defined like for some call center applications. However, for more open-ended or critical applications, careful design and testing are crucial.
As developers, our challenge is to harness the power of Agentic RAG while managing its complexities. This involves not just understanding the technical aspects of implementation and integration, but also tackling issues of reliability, user experience, and more.
The potential for Agentic RAG is huge. It could be the backbone for AI systems that are more flexible, more capable, and better able to handle complex, multi-step tasks. But realizing this potential in production-ready applications will require ongoing research, careful implementation and testing, and a deep understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of these systems.

## Understanding agentic AI
**Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to autonomously pursue complex goals and workflows with limited direct human supervision. **Agentic AI exhibits autonomous decision-making, planning, and adaptive execution to complete multi-step processes.
At its core, agentic AI aims to operate more like a human employee — understanding context and instructions in natural language, setting appropriate goals, reasoning through subtasks, and adapting decisions and actions based on changing conditions.
**The critical capabilities of agentic AI include:**
**Autonomy**: The ability to take goal-directed actions with minimal human oversight**Reasoning**: Contextual decision-making to make judgment calls and weigh tradeoffs**Adaptable planning**: Dynamic adjustment of goals and plans based on changing conditions**Language understanding**: Comprehending and following natural language instructions**Workflow optimization**: Fluidly moving between subtasks and applications to complete processes efficiently
Together, these features enable agentic AI to operate autonomously, proactively, and intelligently, increasing its ability to perform complex workflows across the enterprise.
### How agentic AI differs from traditional AI
**Conventional AI is typically programmed to augment specific repetitive or routine tasks.** While valuable, this narrow AI lacks the bigger-picture understanding and judgment needed for complex workflows.
In contrast, agentic AI leverages innovations like:
- Large language models (LLMs) that comprehend nuanced human speech
- Scalable computing power to train complex models
- Massive datasets to enable deep learning
- The ability to connect and interact with other systems
These key innovations allow agentic AI to set autonomous goals, plan, reason, and adapt when tackling complex objectives across dynamic environments.
**Agentic AI represents a seismic shift.** With it, enterprise AI tools, like AI copilots, can leverage nuanced language understanding to interpret instructions more accurately while proactively moving between subtasks to complete workflows and making context-aware decisions, reacting intelligently as conditions change. This is to say that agentic architecture unlocks new frontiers of automation, efficiency, and optimized operations.
## The evolution of agentic AI systems
Conversational AI has rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to intelligent copilots that can understand language and autonomously make decisions.
Early conversational AI relied on basic pattern matching and prompted responses within narrow, pre-defined domains. These systems lacked deeper language comprehension and could only handle simple queries.
As conversational models have been trained on exponentially more data, their plausibly human responses across a wide range of prompts have drastically improved. Large language models like GPT-4 demonstrate strong generative abilities to produce natural-sounding content.
However, enterprise-wide use cases require more than just well-thought-out responses — **enterprises need AI agents that can reliably manage complex goals and workflows.** This demand has driven the emergence of agentic capabilities like autonomous goal-setting, reasoning, decision-making, robust language understanding, and the ability to connect with enterprise systems using plugins.
These agentic capabilities unlock a new generation of enterprise AI solutions — including AI copilots. These tools are being designed to operate without constant human oversight across varied domains. In this way, agentic systems interpret instructions more accurately, set subgoals to accomplish multi-step tasks, and make adaptive choices adjusting to real-time developments, enabling reliable automation of convoluted business objectives.
### Industry leaders in agentic AI
**Microsoft's Project AutoGen**demonstrates a multi-agent framework that simplifies building workflows and applications with LLMs. It features specialized agents that can be configured with different LLMs and enables seamless human interaction.**Allen Institute for AI's Lumos**showcases an open-source modular agent that can understand natural language, reason to formulate plans, and execute actions. It is trained on a diverse, unified dataset covering different interactive tasks.**Moveworks’ Next-Gen Copilot**has been architected with autonomous goal-setting, reasoning, planning, and execution powered by an agentic architecture and plug-in integrations. This approach enables the Moveworks Copilot to reliably automate complex business workflows with minimal oversight across systems.
These and other innovations showcase the rapid evolution of agentic systems that can productively operate with minimal supervision across dynamic domains.
## Unpacking the pros and cons of agentic AI in the enterprise
Agentic AI promises to bring big productivity benefits to companies. But businesses need to be careful when using this new technology.
While there is power in these systems’ abilities to set their own goals and make decisions independently, this autonomy can lead to two major risks:
- First, these systems rely on statistical models that don't always capture rare edge cases. So, they can suggest actions that seem sensible but actually cause problems. Without oversight, flawed recommendations could lead to critical operational issues.
- Second, the complex reasoning these systems use to set goals and make choices is difficult for people to understand. Their thinking process can be opaque, and this lack of transparency makes it hard to audit or trust the AI.
To use agentic AI responsibly, it is best if companies do the following:
- Require explanations from the AI to make its reasoning transparent.
- Give humans oversight powers to validate the AI's goals and decisions.
- Test the AI extensively to catch potential flaws and edge cases.
- Implement controls and steering mechanisms so the AI's autonomy is constrained.
With good design and safeguards, companies can benefit from agentic AI's productivity while minimizing risks from its autonomy. The key is balancing powerful AI capabilities with responsible oversight and transparency.
## Agentic AI and its potential impact on enterprises
The limitations of conventional AI systems mean they cannot reliably achieve complex objectives or operate independently across diverse environments. People are still required to heavily oversee their work.
Agentic AI promises to radically reshape organizational workflows, roles, and relationships. As AI assistants gain advanced reasoning and planning abilities, they unlock the capacity to take on responsibilities previously reserved for humans.
Agentic AI promises to unlock new benefits for enterprises:

 # Agentic RAG: Personalizing and Optimizing Knowledge-Augmented Language Models
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, despite their impressive performance, LLMs often face limitations such as hallucinations, temporal misalignments, and context processing issues [1]. To address these challenges, research has focused on enhancing LLMs by integrating them with external knowledge sources through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1].
RAG aims to improve the ability of language models to understand and generate accurate responses by retrieving and incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. By leveraging this additional context, RAG systems have demonstrated significant improvements in answering complex questions more accurately and contextually [1]. However, as the RAG framework has evolved and expanded, new challenges have emerged, particularly in the areas of retrieval quality, efficiency, and personalization.
To transcend these limitations, researchers have introduced ERAGent, a cutting-edge RAG framework that embodies significant advancements in the field [1]. ERAGent is designed to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and personalization of retrieval-augmented language models through the integration of several novel components and technologies.

**Sample Application of Agentic Technology**: In the example provided, I have developed an Agentic RAG QnA chatbot designed to respond to queries based on the content of an uploaded document. This application processes the PDF file into vectors, storing them as embeddings in a Vector Database.
Depending on the nature of your inquiry, the tool’s agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize in order to respond to the customer’s question. For example:
- If the customer needs to book an appointment or schedule a consultation, the agent activates the appointment tool, which then provides a dynamic calendar booking URL.
- If the customer inquires about the status of an order or has questions regarding the order, the agent assigns this task to the WISMO tool, which retrieves data from the Order Management System (OMS).
- If the customer queries about the details of the uploaded document, the tools agent orchestrates this question to the document retrieval tool to perform a vector similarity search and deliver the results.
**RAG Pipeline**
**Ingestion:**

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process. In this regard, let’s delve into some potential avenues.

 Retrieval Augmented Generation systems, better known as RAG systems, have quickly become popular for building Generative AI assistants on custom enterprise data. They avoid the hassles of expensive fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). One of the key advantages of RAG systems is you can easily integrate your data, augment your LLM’s intelligence, and give more contextual answers to your questions. However, a whole set of problems can make RAG systems underperform and, worse, give wrong answers to your questions! In this guide, we will look at a way to see how AI Agents can augment the capabilities of a traditional RAG system and improve on some of its limitations.
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system architecture typically consists of two major steps:
In Step 1, Data Processing and Indexing, we focus on getting our custom enterprise data into a more consumable format by loading the text content and other artifacts like tables and images, splitting large documents into smaller chunks, converting them into embeddings using an embedder model and then storing these chunks and embeddings into a vector database as depicted in the following figure.
In Step 2 of the workflow, the process begins with the user posing a question. Chunks of relevant documents similar to the input question are retrieved from the vector database. These are then forwarded along with the question to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a human-like response, as depicted in the accompanying figure.
This two-step workflow is commonly used in the industry to build a traditional RAG system; however, it comes with its own set of limitations.
Traditional RAG systems have several limitations, some of which are mentioned as follows:
In this article, we will focus particularly on the limitations of the RAG system, which does not have access to real-time data, as well as make sure the retrieved document chunks are actually relevant to answer the question. This will allow the RAG system to answer questions on more recent events and real-time data and be less prone to hallucinations.
The inspiration for our agentic RAG system will be based on the solution proposed in the paper,* Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation, Yan et al.* , where they propose a workflow as depicted in the following figure to enhance a regular RAG system. The key idea here is to retrieve document chunks from the vector database as usual and then use an LLM to check if each retrieved document chunk is relevant to the input question.
If all the retrieved document chunks are relevant, then it goes to the LLM for a normal response generation like a standard RAG pipeline. However, suppose some retrieved documents are not relevant to the input question. In that case, we rephrase the input query, search the web to retrieve new information related to the input question, and then send it to the LLM to generate a response.
The key novelty in this approach is to search the web, augment static information in the vector database with more live and real-time information, and check if retrieved documents are relevant to the input question, something that cannot be captured by simply embedding cosine similarity.
AI Agents or Agentic AI systems have seen a rise, especially in 2024, which enables us to build Generative AI systems that can reason, analyze, interact, and take actions automatically. The whole idea of Agentic AI is to build completely autonomous systems that can understand and manage complex workflows and tasks with minimal human intervention. Agentic systems can grasp nuanced concepts, set and pursue goals, reason through tasks, and adapt their actions based on changing conditions. These systems can consist of a single agent or even multiple agents, as shown in the example below, where we have two agents working together to ensure the user’s instructions can be transformed into working code snippets.
One can use various frameworks to build Agentic AI systems, including CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, and many more. Using these frameworks enables us to develop complex workflows with ease. Remember, an agent is basically one or more LLMs having access to a set of tools that they can leverage based on specific prompt-based instructions to answer user questions.
We will be using LangGraph for our practical implementation of our Agentic RAG system. LangGraph, built on top of LangChain, facilitates the creation of cyclical graphs essential for developing AI agents powered by LLMs. The widely-used NetworkX library inspires its interface. It enables the coordination and checkpointing of multiple chains (or actors) through cyclic computational steps. LangGraph treats Agent workflows as a cyclical Graph structure, as depicted in the following figure.
The main components in any LangGraph agent include:
LangGraph leverages this to facilitate cyclical LLM call executions with state persistence, which AI agents often require.
In this section, we will see a high-level workflow of the main components in our Agentic RAG system and the execution flow among these components. The following figure illustrates this in detail.
Each component in this workflow is represented by a node. There are two major flows here in this Agentic RAG system. One flow is the regular RAG system workflow, where we have a user question and retrieve context documents from the vector database. However, we introduce an additional step here based on the corrective RAG paper where we use an LLM to check if all retrieved documents are relevant to the user question (in the grade node); if they are all relevant, then we generate a response using an LLM as shown in the following snapshot.
The other flow occurs in case at least one or more of the retrieved context documents from the vector database are irrelevant to the user question, as depicted in the following snapshot. Then, we leverage an LLM to rewrite the user query and optimize it for search on the web. Next, we leverage a web search tool to search the web using this rephrased query and get some new documents. Finally, we send the query and any relevant context documents (including the web search documents) to an LLM to generate a response.
Now, deep dive into a detailed system architecture for our Agentic Corrective RAG System. We will understand each component and what happens step-by-step in the workflow. The following illustration depicts this in detail.
We will start with a user query that goes to the vector database (we will be using Chroma) and retrieves some context documents. There is a possibility that no documents could be retrieved if the user query is based on recent events or topics outside the scope of our initial data in the vector database.
In the next step, we will send our user query and context documents to an LLM and make it act as a document grader. It will grade each context document as **‘Yes’** or **‘No’** depending on whether they are relevant to the user query in terms of meaning and context.
The next step involves the decision node where there are two possible pathways, let’s consider the first path which is taken if ALL the context documents are relevant to the user query.
If all the documents are relevant to the input query, then we go through a standard RAG flow where the documents and query are sent to an LLM to generate a contextual response as an answer for the user query.
The other path is taken from the decision node only if at least one or more context documents are irrelevant to the user query OR there are no context documents for the given user query. Then, we take the user query, send it to an LLM, and ask it to rephrase the user query to optimize it for searching on the web.
The next step involves invoking the web search tool, in our implementation we will be using the Tavily Web Search API tool to search the web and get relevant information as context documents and then add them to the list of any relevant context documents retrieved from the vector database.
The next step is going through the same RAG flow of response generation using the query and context documents, including the real-time information retrieved from the web.
We will now implement the Agentic RAG System we have discussed so far using LangGraph. We will be loading some documents from Wikipedia into our vector database, the Chroma database. and also using the Tavily Search tool for web search. Connections to LLMs and prompting will be made with LangChain, and the agent will be built using LangGraph. For our LLM, we will be using ChatGPT GPT-4o, which is a powerful LLM that has native support for tool calling. However, you are free to use any other LLM, also including open-source LLMs, it is recommended to use a powerful LLM, fine-tuned for tool calling to get the best performance.
We start by installing the necessary dependencies, which are going to be the libraries we will be using to build our system.

`TAVILY_API_KEY = getpass('Enter Tavily Search API Key: ')`
Next, we setup some system environment variables that will be used later when authenticating LLMs and searching APIs.
```
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = OPENAI_KEY
os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = TAVILY_API_KEY
```
We will now build a vector database for retrieval and search by taking a subset of documents from Wikipedia; these documents have already been extracted from Wikipedia and are available in an archived file.
LangChain enables us to access Open AI embedding models, which include the newest models: a smaller and highly efficient text-embedding-3-small model and a larger and more powerful text-embedding-3-large model. We need an embedding model to convert our document chunks into embeddings before storing them in our vector database.
```

We will now unzip the data archive, load the documents, split and chunk them into more manageable document chunks before indexing them.
```
import gzip
import json
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
wikipedia_filepath = 'simplewiki-2020-11-01.jsonl.gz'
docs = []
with gzip.open(wikipedia_filepath, 'rt', encoding='utf8') as fIn:
for line in fIn:
data = json.loads(line.strip())
#Add documents
docs.append({
'metadata': {
'title': data.get('title'),
'article_id': data.get('id')
},
'data': ' '.join(data.get('paragraphs')[0:3])
# restrict data to first 3 paragraphs to run later modules faster
})
# We subset our data to use a subset of wikipedia documents to run things faster
docs = [doc for doc in docs for x in ['india']
if x in doc['data'].lower().split()]
# Create docs
docs = [Document(page_content=doc['data'],
metadata=doc['metadata']) for doc in docs]
# Chunk docs
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=300)
chunked_docs = splitter.split_documents(docs)
chunked_docs[:3]
```
**OUTPUT**
[Document(page_content='Basil ("Ocimum basilicum") ( or ) is a plant of the
Family Lamiaceae. It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi..... but this
likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.',

Here, we initialize a connection to a Chroma vector DB client, and we also want to save the data to disk, so we simply initialize the Chroma client and pass the directory where we want the data to be saved. We also specify to use the Open AI embedding model to transform each document chunk into an embedding and to store the document chunks and their corresponding embeddings in the vector database index.
```
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
# create vector DB of docs and embeddings - takes < 30s on Colab
chroma_db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunked_docs,
collection_name='rag_wikipedia_db',
embedding=openai_embed_model,
# need to set the distance function to cosine else it uses Euclidean by default
# check https://docs.trychroma.com/guides#changing-the-distance-function
collection_metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"},
persist_directory="./wikipedia_db")
```
Here, we use the Similarity with Threshold Retrieval strategy, which uses cosine similarity and retrieves the top 3 similar documents based on the user input query and also introduces a cutoff to not return any documents that are below a certain similarity threshold (0.3 in this case).
```
similarity_threshold_retriever = chroma_db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
search_kwargs={"k": 3,
"score_threshold": 0.3})
We can then test if our retriever is working on some sample queries.
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
top3_docs
```
**OUTPUT**
[Document(page_content='New Delhi () is the capital of India and a union
territory of the megacity of Delhi. .......population of about 9.4 Million
people.', metadata={'article_id': '5117', 'title': 'New Delhi'}),

'Mumbai'}),
Document(page_content='The Republic of India is divided into twenty-eight
States,and ...... Territory.', metadata={'article_id': '22215', 'title':

For queries without relevant documents in the vector database, we will get an empty list, as shown in the following example query.
```
query = "what is langgraph?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
top3_docs
```
**OUTPUT**
Here, we will use an LLM itself to grade if any retrieved document is relevant to the given question – The answer will be either yes or no. The LLM, in our case, will be GPT-4o.
```
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# Data model for LLM output format
class GradeDocuments(BaseModel):
"""Binary score for relevance check on retrieved documents."""
binary_score: str = Field(
description="Documents are relevant to the question, 'yes' or 'no'"
)
# LLM for grading
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
structured_llm_grader = llm.with_structured_output(GradeDocuments)
# Prompt template for grading
SYS_PROMPT = """You are an expert grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question.

grade_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
[
("system", SYS_PROMPT),
("human", """Retrieved document:

]
)
# Build grader chain
doc_grader = (grade_prompt
|
structured_llm_grader)
```
We can test out this grader on some sample user queries and see how relevant are the retrieved context documents from the vector database.
```
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
for doc in top3_docs:
print(doc.page_content)
print('GRADE:', doc_grader.invoke({"question": query,
"document": doc.page_content}))
print()
```
**OUTPUT**
New Delhi () is the capital of India ......
GRADE: binary_score='yes'
Mumbai (previously known as Bombay until 1996) ......
GRADE: binary_score='no'
The Republic of India is divided ......
GRADE: binary_score='no'
We can see that the LLM does a pretty good job of detecting relevant and irrelevant documents about the user query.
Here, we will connect our retriever to an LLM, GPT-4o, in our case, and build our Question-answering RAG chain. Remember, this will be our traditional RAG system, which we will integrate with an AI Agent later.
```
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

```
The idea here is to get the user query, retrieve the context documents from the vector database or web search, and then send them as inputs to the RAG prompt mentioned above, which goes into GPT-4o to generate a human-like response. Let’s test out a few queries in our traditional RAG system now.
```
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_rag_chain.invoke(
{"context": top3_docs, "question": query}
)
print(result)
```
**OUTPUT**
The capital of India is New Delhi. It is also a union territory and part of
the megacity of Delhi.
Let’s now try a question that is out of context, such that no context documents related to the question are there in the vector database.
```
query = "who won the champions league in 2024?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_rag_chain.invoke(
{"context": top3_docs, "question": query}
)
print(result)
```
**OUTPUT**
I don't know the answer. The provided context does not contain information
about the winner of the Champions League in 2024.
The RAG system behaves as expected; the shortcoming here is that it cannot answer out-of-context questions, which is what we will try to improve on in the next steps

We will now build a query rephraser, which will use an LLM, GPT-4o in our case, to rephrase the input user query into a better version that is optimized for web search. This will help us get better context information from the web for our query.
```
# LLM for question rewriting
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
# Prompt template for rewriting
SYS_PROMPT = """Act as a question re-writer and perform the following task:
- Convert the following input question to a better version that is optimized for web search.

""",
),
]
)
# Create rephraser chain
question_rewriter = (re_write_prompt
|
llm
|
StrOutputParser())
```
Let’s try this on a sample question to see how our rephraser chain works.
```
query = "who won the champions league in 2024?"
question_rewriter.invoke({"question": query})
```
**OUTPUT**
Who was the winner of the 2024 UEFA Champions League?
Here, we will use the Tavily API for our web searches, so we load up a connection to this API. For our searches, we will use the top 3 search results as additional context information; however, you are free to load in more search results.
```
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
tv_search = TavilySearchResults(max_results=3, search_depth='advanced',max_tokens=10000)
```
Here, we will build the key components of our Agentic Corrective RAG System as per the workflow we discussed earlier in our guide. These functions will be put into relevant agent nodes via LangGraph later on when we build our agent.
This is used to store and represent the state of the agent graph as we traverse through various nodes. It will store and keep track of the user query, a flag variable telling us if a web search is needed, a list of context documents (retrieved from the vector database and \ or web search), and the LLM-generated response.
```
from typing import List
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
class GraphState(TypedDict):
"""
Represents the state of our graph.
Attributes:
question: question
generation: LLM response generation
web_search_needed: flag of whether to add web search - yes or no
documents: list of context documents
"""
question: str
generation: str
web_search_needed: str
documents: List[str]
```
This will be used to get relevant context documents from the vector database using our retriever, which we built earlier. Remember, as this will be a node in the agent graph, later on, we will be getting the user question from the graph state and then pass it to our retriever to get relevant context documents from the vector database.
```
def retrieve(state):
"""
Retrieve documents
Args:
state (dict): The current graph state
Returns:
state (dict): New key added to state, documents - that contains retrieved context documents
"""
print("---RETRIEVAL FROM VECTOR DB---")
question = state["question"]
# Retrieval
documents = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(question)
return {"documents": documents, "question": question}
```
This will be used to determine whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the question using an LLM Grader. It sets the web_search_needed flag as Yes if at least one document is not contextually relevant OR no context documents were retrieved. Otherwise, it sets the flag as No if all documents are contextually relevant to the given user query. It updates the state graph by ensuring context documents consist of only relevant documents.
```
def grade_documents(state):
"""

print("---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---")
question = state["question"]
documents = state["documents"]
# Score each doc
filtered_docs = []
web_search_needed = "No"
if documents:
for d in documents:
score = doc_grader.invoke(
{"question": question, "document": d.page_content}
)
grade = score.binary_score
if grade == "yes":
print("---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---")
filtered_docs.append(d)

continue
else:
print("---NO DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED---")
web_search_needed = "Yes"
return {"documents": filtered_docs, "question": question,
"web_search_needed": web_search_needed}
```
This will be used to rewrite the input query to produce a better question optimized for web search using an LLM, this will also update the query in the state graph so it can be accessed by other nodes in our agent graph which we will be creating shortly.
```
def rewrite_query(state):
"""
Rewrite the query to produce a better question.
Args:
state (dict): The current graph state

question = state["question"]
documents = state["documents"]
# Re-write question
better_question = question_rewriter.invoke({"question": question})
return {"documents": documents, "question": better_question}
```
This will be used to search the web using the web search tool for the given query and retrieve some information from the web, which can be used as additional context documents in our RAG system. We will use the Tavily Search API tool in our system, as discussed earlier. This function also updates the state graph, especially the list of context documents, with new documents retrieved from the web for the rephrased user query.
```
from langchain.schema import Document
def web_search(state):
"""
Web search based on the re-written question.

web_results = "\n\n".join([d["content"] for d in docs])
web_results = Document(page_content=web_results)
documents.append(web_results)
return {"documents": documents, "question": question}
```
This is the standard LLM response generation function from query and context documents in an RAG system. We also update the generation field in the state graph so we can access it anytime in our agent graph and output the response to the user as needed.
```
def generate_answer(state):
"""
Generate answer from context document using LLM
Args:
state (dict): The current graph state
Returns:
state (dict): New key added to state, generation, that contains LLM generation

question = state["question"]
documents = state["documents"]
# RAG generation
generation = qa_rag_chain.invoke({"context": documents, "question": question})
return {"documents": documents, "question": question,
"generation": generation}
```
This will be used as a conditional function to check the web_search_needed flag from the agent graph state and decide if a web search or response should be generated, and return the function name to be called. It will return the rewrite_query string if a web search is needed, as then our agentic RAG system would go into the flow of query rephrasing, followed by search and then response generation. If a web search is unnecessary, the function will return the generate_answer string, enabling our RAG system to go into the regular flow of generating a response from the given context documents and query. This function will be used in the conditional node in our agent graph to help route the flow to the right function based on the two possible pathways.
```
def decide_to_generate(state):
"""
Determines whether to generate an answer, or re-generate a question.
Args:
state (dict): The current graph state
Returns:
str: Binary decision for next node to call
"""
print("---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---")
web_search_needed = state["web_search_needed"]
if web_search_needed == "Yes":
# All documents have been filtered check_relevance
# We will re-generate a new query
print("---DECISION: SOME or ALL DOCUMENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO QUESTION, REWRITE QUERY---")
return "rewrite_query"
else:
# We have relevant documents, so generate answer
print("---DECISION: GENERATE RESPONSE---")
return "generate_answer"
```
Here, we will use LangGraph and build the agent as a graph using the functions we implemented in the previous section, put them in relevant nodes as per our Agentic RAG system architecture, and connect them with relevant edges as per the defined workflows
```
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
agentic_rag = StateGraph(GraphState)
# Define the nodes
agentic_rag.add_node("retrieve", retrieve) # retrieve
agentic_rag.add_node("grade_documents", grade_documents) # grade documents
agentic_rag.add_node("rewrite_query", rewrite_query) # transform_query
agentic_rag.add_node("web_search", web_search) # web search
agentic_rag.add_node("generate_answer", generate_answer) # generate answer
# Build graph
agentic_rag.set_entry_point("retrieve")
agentic_rag.add_edge("retrieve", "grade_documents")
agentic_rag.add_conditional_edges(
"grade_documents",
decide_to_generate,
{"rewrite_query": "rewrite_query", "generate_answer": "generate_answer"},
)
agentic_rag.add_edge("rewrite_query", "web_search")
agentic_rag.add_edge("web_search", "generate_answer")
agentic_rag.add_edge("generate_answer", END)
# Compile
agentic_rag = agentic_rag.compile()
```
We can now visualize our Agentic RAG System workflow using the following code.
```
from IPython.display import Image, display, Markdown
display(Image(agentic_rag.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```
Finally, we are ready to test our Agentic RAG System live on some user queries! Since we have put print statements inside relevant functions in our graph nodes we can see them being printed also as the execution happens in the graph.
```
query = "what is the capital of India?"
response = agentic_rag.invoke({"question": query})
```
**OUTPUT**

---GENERATE ANSWER—
We can see that some documents retrieved from the vector database were not relevant so it has also retrieved context information from the web successfully and generated a response, we can check out the generated response now.
`display(Markdown(response['generation']))`
**OUTPUT**
The capital city of India is New Delhi. It is a union territory within the
larger metropolitan area of Delhi and is situated in the north-central part
of the country on the west bank of the Yamuna River. New Delhi was formally
dedicated as the capital in 1931 and has a population of about 9.4 million
people.
Let’s try another scenario where no relevant context documents exist in the vector database for the given user query.
```
query = "who won the champions league in 2024?"
response = agentic_rag.invoke({"question": query})
```
**OUTPUT**
---RETRIEVAL FROM VECTOR DB---
---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---
---GRADE: DOCUMENT NOT RELEVANT---
---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---
---DECISION: SOME or ALL DOCUMENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO QUESTION, REWRITE QUERY---
---REWRITE QUERY---
---WEB SEARCH---
---GENERATE ANSWER---
The system seems to be working as expected, it doesn’t have any context documents so it retrieves new information from the web using the web search tool to generate a response to our query. We can check the response now.
`display(Markdown(response['generation']))`
**OUTPUT**
The winner of the 2024 UEFA Champions League was Real Madrid. They secured
victory in the final against Borussia Dortmund with goals from Dani Carvajal
and Vinicius Junior.
Let’s test our last scenario to check whether the flow works fine. In this scenario, all retrieved documents from the vector database are relevant to the user query, so ideally, no web search should take place.
```
query = "Tell me about India"
response = agentic_rag.invoke({"question": query})
```
**OUTPUT**
---RETRIEVAL FROM VECTOR DB---
---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---
---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---
---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---
---GRADE: DOCUMENT RELEVANT---

 # Agentic RAG: What it is, its types, applications and implementation
### Recent developments with LLM and RAG
In information retrieval and natural language processing, current developments with LLM and RAG have ushered in a new era of efficiency and sophistication. Amidst recent developments with LLM and RAG, significant strides have been made in four key areas: Enhanced retrieval: Optimizing information retrieval within RAG systems is crucial for performance. Recent advancements focus on reranking algorithms and hybrid search methodologies to refine search precision. Employing multiple vectors per document allows for a granular content representation, enhancing relevance identification. Semantic caching: To mitigate computational costs and ensure response consistency, semantic caching has emerged as a key strategy. By storing answers to recent queries alongside their semantic context, similar requests can be efficiently addressed without repeated LLM calls, facilitating faster response times and consistent information delivery. Multimodal integration: This expands the capabilities of LLM and RAG beyond text, integrating images and other modalities. This facilitates access to a broader array of source materials and enables seamless interactions between textual and visual data, resulting in more thorough and nuanced responses. These advancements set the stage for further exploration into the intricacies of agentic RAG, which will be delved into in detail in the upcoming sections.
### What is agentic RAG?
Agentic RAG stands for Agent-based RAG implementation.
Agentic RAG revolutionizes our approach to question answering by introducing an innovative framework based on intelligent agents. In contrast to conventional methods relying solely on large language models (LLMs), agentic RAG employs these agents to tackle complex questions that demand intricate planning, multi-step reasoning, and the utilization of external tools. These agents function as proficient researchers, skillfully navigating through multiple documents, analyzing information, crafting summaries, and furnishing comprehensive and precise answers. The implementation of agentic RAG is highly scalable; additional documents can be seamlessly integrated, each managed by a sub-agent.
Picture it as having a team of expert researchers at your disposal, each possessing unique skills and capabilities, collaborating to meet your information requirements. Whether you seek to compare perspectives across various documents, explore the nuances of a particular document, or synthesize information from diverse summaries, agentic RAG agents are adeptly equipped to handle the task with accuracy and efficiency.
### Various usage patterns of agentic RAG
Agents operating within a RAG framework demonstrate diverse usage patterns, each finely tuned to specific tasks and goals. These patterns underscore the adaptability and flexibility of agents when engaging with RAG systems. Below are the primary patterns of agent usage within the RAG context:
1. Utilization of existing RAG pipelines as tools: Agents can employ established RAG pipelines to execute particular tasks or generate outputs efficiently. By tapping into these pipelines, agents streamline their operations and capitalize on the framework's inherent capabilities.
2. Autonomous operation as standalone RAG tools: Agents possess the capability to operate independently as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy enables agents to generate responses directly from input queries, without dependence on external tools or pipelines.
3. Dynamic tool retrieval based on query context: Agents can dynamically retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the contextual cues provided by the query. This adaptive tool retrieval empowers agents to tailor their actions according to the specific needs of each query.
4. Query planning across available tools: Agents excel in query planning tasks by analyzing input queries and selecting appropriate tools from a predefined set within the RAG system. This capacity enables agents to optimize tool selection based on query requirements and desired outcomes.
5. Selection of tools from the candidate pool: In scenarios where the RAG system offers a diverse array of tools, agents assist in selecting the most suitable option from the pool of candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures alignment between the chosen tool and the query context and objectives.
### Real-world applications and use cases of agentic RAG
Agentic RAG represents a paradigm shift in information processing, offering a versatile toolkit for various industries and domains. From enhancing organizational efficiency to transforming customer experiences, Agentic RAG has diverse applications across different sectors.

## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
## How to implement agentic RAG?

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process. In this regard, let’s delve into some potential avenues.

 **One of the fastest growing use cases for LLMs is RAG, or retrieval augmented generation.** In this use case, the context window of an LLM is enhanced with grounded content (like search results, meeting transcriptions, etc), and then the LLM is able to generate a succinct summary.
Combined with use of LLMs for embeddings and retrieval, this has breathed a new life in RAG use cases, especially search.
However, we are now beginning to understand how **RAG architecture has scaling challenges.** The belief was that if you give vast amounts of data to an LLM, it will be able to sort through it and provide correct results.
Unfortunately, this is turning out to be a problem. We often hear of customers who run into poor results as they add multiple data sources into an existing RAG based search tool. These poor results often show irrelevant or low quality results, even when higher quality and more relevant content is available.
Let me explain by an example. Let’s say I am a salesperson and I want to find information about an opportunity. I have connected my copilot or assistant to a diverse set of sources — from CRM, email, calendar, Slack, Google Drive, etc.
When I ask about the status of an opportunity, a basic RAG-based search engine does not have any insight about where to go — and which source to trust. What if I want to know about the most recent updates on an opportunity. What if I want to find out when an opportunity would close? What if I want to find out when I am meeting a customer next?
As you can tell, a RAG-based architecture will return an unpredictable and generally unreliable set of results. It might highlight results from an email when I ask about the status of an opportunity instead of CRM, or it might highlight results from Slack if I ask about the health of a customer instead of Gainsight . It might go to CRM for the most recent update on an opportunity when it should probably go to Slack or Teams.
You get the point, the chief weakness in this architecture is that a RAG system does not have any ability to decide which content system is the preferred store of certain kinds of content.
To fully appreciate the advancements in agentic RAG, it’s crucial to understand the foundations of retrieval augmented generation. Let’s examine the core principles and mechanics of basic RAG systems.
## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?
Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an architectural approach that enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. This method allows LLMs to access and incorporate up-to-date information beyond their initial training data.
The basic RAG process consists of the following components:
A pre-trained language model serving as the base architecture
An external knowledge base containing relevant, current information
A retrieval mechanism to access pertinent data from the knowledge base
An augmentation process that incorporates retrieved information into the model's generation pipeline
**This is to say that RAG helps AI give more accurate and up-to-date answers.** This architecture enables LLMs to generate responses that are both linguistically coherent and factually grounded in current, domain-specific knowledge.
Importantly, RAG is why various AI tools can now use your company's data to answer questions. They can look at things like chat messages, customer info, and even obscure, old reports to find the answers you're looking for. As a result of this technique — search got smarter. Chatbots became genuinely helpful. The AI world took notice, and RAG applications exploded.
But RAG isn't perfect yet. It's still new and has some problems. We're working on making it even better.
## The problem with basic RAG
In short, RAG systems are having trouble with too much data. Many companies thought just adding more info would make AI smarter. But that's proving to be counterproductive.
**The main issue is that RAG can't easily decide what's important in all this data.** Increasing the volume of data doesn't equate to improved intelligence; instead, it's like searching for a needle in a haystack by adding more hay. This is to say that when companies connect many data sources to their RAG tool, they often get bad answers, even when good info is there.
For example: I’m a salesperson and I want to find information about an opportunity. My AI-powered copilot can look in many places — sales records, emails, calendars, chat messages, and files.
**But this RAG-based search system doesn't know where to look first or which source to trust.** What if I want to know about the most recent updates on an opportunity? What if I want to find out when an opportunity would close? What if I want to find out when I am meeting a customer next? It might pull information from an email instead of CRM or from Notion instead of Gainsight, leading to unpredictable and generally unreliable results.
Basic RAG often misses the best information. It might ignore expert knowledge and use less reliable sources instead. I've witnessed numerous instances where customers realize their sophisticated RAG tool is producing subpar results, despite having access to the best, most up-to-date information. This isn't merely frustrating — it can be potentially harmful in critical business scenarios.
**The fundamental issue is that RAG alone can't choose the best place to look for specific questions.** It's not smart enough to understand the context of what it's looking for. Basic RAG is reaching its limits. Just adding more data isn't the answer. We need a smarter way that not only finds info but also comprehends and contextualizes it.
## How agentic AI makes RAG better
Basic RAG has problems when there's too much data. Agentic AI can help fix this.
Agentic AI adds a "reasoner" to RAG. The reasoner doesn't just pull data; it understands the nuances of the person asking, including the question itself and the context.
In a basic RAG system, there’s no clear plan for why certain data is retrieved. **Agentic RAG creates a purpose-driven approach to retrieval.**
Here's what the reasoner does:
It guesses what the user really wants based on their identity
It makes a plan to find and use the right information
It uses context to understand the relative importance and reliability of various data sources
For example, if someone asks about a recent sales update, the reasoner might prioritize real-time communication tools like Slack or Teams over more static sources like CRM entries. This helps find newer, more useful information.
The reasoner also checks if the information is good before showing it to the user. It tries to use the best sources and avoid unreliable ones.
This means:
- You get more current and relevant answers
- The AI is less likely to use old or wrong information
- You see better results, even when there's lots of data to search through
It’s important to note that agentic RAG can also change its plan if needed. If it doesn’t find good information in one place, it looks somewhere else. If it queries the CRM and finds no recent updates, it can pivot to other sources like call notes or project management tools. This adaptability ensures that users get the most pertinent information available.
Even more crucially, **agentic RAG doesn’t just find data — it gets it ready to use. **This might mean:
- Translating
- Doing math
- Verifying information
And that’s where agentic “skills” really come into focus.
The generative nature of agentic RAG grants it the ability to independently problem solve. Agentic RAG can sequence and chain together multiple generative actions on its own or within the systems its retrieving information from.
Simply put, **agentic RAG can take action on its own**. It can even do complex tasks by breaking them into smaller steps.
Let’s go back to another sales example. Imagine that same rep has progressed their deal and is working to close that opportunity they’ve been working. A RAG solution could point them toward sourcing the documents and process descriptions of quote creation. An agentic RAG solution, however, would be capable of drafting that quote with the specifics of that user’s specified account.
The plan might encompass creating a quote draft from the standard quoting template. It also fills in the standard deal fields from CRM data. Baseline costs are generated from the information contained within the most recent pricebook. Let’s also imagine the rep wants to add a discount to the prospect to sweeten the deal — they instruct it to apply a certain percentage discount and AI is capable of calculating and adjusting that quote. Notably, each of these seemingly simple tasks requires multiple steps to achieve.
This is very different from basic RAG. Agentic RAG can do many useful things all at once, making it much more helpful for users.
## Upleveling the Moveworks Copilot’s architecture with agentic AI

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process.

However, SLMs, primarily trained on text, may need help with continuous time series data and patterns like seasonality. Recent approaches, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enhance models with external knowledge, offering new possibilities for improving time series analysis and complex goal-oriented tasks.
Researchers from IIT Dharwad and TCS Research propose an agentic RAG framework for time series analysis using a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture. A master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents, each fine-tuned with SLMs for specific time series tasks like forecasting or anomaly detection. These sub-agents retrieve relevant prompts from specialized knowledge repositories, or prompt pools, that store historical patterns, enabling better predictions on new data. This modular approach enhances flexibility and accuracy, outperforming traditional methods across various time series tasks by effectively addressing complex challenges.
The proposed method introduces a framework for time series analysis, utilizing a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where a master agent coordinates specialized sub-agents focused on tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation. These sub-agents leverage pre-trained language models and employ a dynamic prompting mechanism to retrieve relevant prompts from an internal knowledge base. This mechanism allows the model to adapt to various trends within complex time series data by accessing historical patterns stored as key-value pairs in a shared prompt pool. The dynamic prompting approach overcomes the limitations of traditional fixed-window methods by enabling the model to adjust to different trends and patterns, enhancing the accuracy of predictions across diverse time series tasks.
Additionally, the framework builds upon recent advancements in SLMs by incorporating a two-tiered attention mechanism to handle long-range dependencies in time series data. The method improves the processing of long sequences without fine-tuning. Still, it also leverages instruction-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to enhance SLM performance on specific time series tasks. This includes improving the context length of SLMs to 32K tokens, enabling them to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the framework utilizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune SLMs, ensuring that the models favor more accurate task-specific outcomes, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of time series analysis.
The proposed Agentic-RAG framework was evaluated across the forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation tasks. It employed variants like SelfExtend-Gemma-2B-instruct, Gemma-7B-instruct, and Llama 3-8B-instruct. Real-world traffic datasets (e.g., PeMS, METR-LA) and multivariate anomaly detection datasets (e.g., SWaT, NASA telemetry) were used. Evaluation metrics included MAE, RMSE, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The framework consistently outperformed baselines in forecasting tasks, especially on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and robustness across all metrics.
In conclusion, The Agentic RAG framework, proposed for time series analysis, addresses challenges like distribution shifts and fixed-length subsequences. It employs a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture with specialized sub-agents for different tasks. These sub-agents use prompt pools as knowledge bases, retrieving relevant information to enhance predictions on new data. The modular design allows the framework to outperform traditional methods in handling complex time series tasks. Using SLMs within this framework enables flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series benchmarks.

 # Agentic RAG: turbocharge your RAG with query reformulation and self-query! 🚀
*Authored by: Aymeric Roucher*
This tutorial is advanced. You should have notions from this other cookbook first!
Reminder: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is “using an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base”. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.
But vanilla RAG has limitations, most importantly these two:
- It
**performs only one retrieval step**: if the results are bad, the generation in turn will be bad. **Semantic similarity is computed with the**, which might be suboptimal: for instance, the user query will often be a question and the document containing the true answer will be in affirmative voice, so its similarity score will be downgraded compared to other source documents in the interrogative form, leading to a risk of missing the relevant information.*user query*as a reference
But we can alleviate these problems by making a **RAG agent: very simply, an agent armed with a retriever tool!**
This agent will: ✅ Formulate the query itself and ✅ Critique to re-retrieve if needed.
So it should naively recover some advanced RAG techniques!
- Instead of directly using the user query as the reference in semantic search, the agent formulates itself a reference sentence that can be closer to the targeted documents, as in HyDE
- The agent can the generated snippets and re-retrieve if needed, as in Self-Query
Let’s build this system. 🛠️
Run the line below to install required dependencies:
`!pip install pandas langchain langchain-community sentence-transformers faiss-cpu "transformers[agents]"`
We first load a knowledge base on which we want to perform RAG: this dataset is a compilation of the documentation pages for many `huggingface`
packages, stored as markdown.
```
import datasets
knowledge_base = datasets.load_dataset("m-ric/huggingface_doc", split="train")
```
Now we prepare the knowledge base by processing the dataset and storing it into a vector database to be used by the retriever.
We use LangChain for its excellent vector database utilities.
For the embedding model, we use thenlper/gte-small since it performed well in our `RAG_evaluation`
cookbook.
```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
>>> from langchain.docstore.document import Document
>>> from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
>>> from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
>>> from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
>>> from langchain_community.vectorstores.utils import DistanceStrategy
>>> from tqdm import tqdm
>>> source_docs = [
... Document(page_content=doc["text"], metadata={"source": doc["source"].split("/")[1]}) for doc in knowledge_base
... ]
>>> text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_huggingface_tokenizer(
... AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("thenlper/gte-small"),
... chunk_size=200,
... chunk_overlap=20,
... add_start_index=True,
... strip_whitespace=True,
... separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", " ", ""],
... )
>>> # Split docs and keep only unique ones
>>> print("Splitting documents...")
>>> docs_processed = []
>>> unique_texts = {}
>>> for doc in tqdm(source_docs):
... new_docs = text_splitter.split_documents([doc])
... for new_doc in new_docs:
... if new_doc.page_content not in unique_texts:
... unique_texts[new_doc.page_content] = True
... docs_processed.append(new_doc)
>>> print("Embedding documents... This should take a few minutes (5 minutes on MacBook with M1 Pro)")
>>> embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="thenlper/gte-small")
>>> vectordb = FAISS.from_documents(
... documents=docs_processed,
... embedding=embedding_model,
... distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,
... )
```
Splitting documents...
Now the database is ready: let’s build our agentic RAG system!
👉 We only need a `RetrieverTool`
that our agent can leverage to retrieve information from the knowledge base.
```
from transformers.agents import Tool
from langchain_core.vectorstores import VectorStore
class RetrieverTool(Tool):
name = "retriever"
description = "Using semantic similarity, retrieves some documents from the knowledge base that have the closest embeddings to the input query."
inputs = {
"query": {
"type": "text",
"description": "The query to perform. This should be semantically close to your target documents. Use the affirmative form rather than a question.",
}
}
output_type = "text"
def __init__(self, vectordb: VectorStore, **kwargs):
super().__init__(**kwargs)
self.vectordb = vectordb
def forward(self, query: str) -> str:
assert isinstance(query, str), "Your search query must be a string"
docs = self.vectordb.similarity_search(
query,
k=7,
)
return "\nRetrieved documents:\n" + "".join(
[f"===== Document {str(i)} =====\n" + doc.page_content for i, doc in enumerate(docs)]
)
```
Now it’s straightforward to create an agent that leverages this tool!
The agent will need these arguments upon initialization:
: a list of tools that the agent will be able to call.`tools`
: the LLM that powers the agent.`llm_engine`
Our `llm_engine`
must be a callable that takes as input a list of messages and returns text. It also needs to accept a `stop_sequences`
argument that indicates when to stop its generation. For convenience, we directly use the `HfEngine`
class provided in the package to get a LLM engine that calls our Inference API.
And we use CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus as the llm engine because:
- It has a long 128k context, which is helpful for processing long source documents
- It is served for free at all times on HF’s Inference API!
```
from transformers.agents import HfEngine, ReactJsonAgent
llm_engine = HfEngine("CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus")
retriever_tool = RetrieverTool(vectordb)
agent = ReactJsonAgent(tools=[retriever_tool], llm_engine=llm_engine, max_iterations=4, verbose=2)
```
Since we initialized the agent as a `ReactJsonAgent`
, it has been automatically given a default system prompt that tells the LLM engine to process step-by-step and generate tool calls as JSON blobs (you could replace this prompt template with your own as needed).
Then when its `.run()`
method is launched, the agent takes care of calling the LLM engine, parsing the tool call JSON blobs and executing these tool calls, all in a loop that ends only when the final answer is provided.
```
>>> agent_output = agent.run("How can I push a model to the Hub?")
>>> print("Final output:")
>>> print(agent_output)
```
Final output: There are multiple ways to push a model to the Hub. Here are a few examples using different libraries and functions: Using the `api`: python api.upload_folder( repo_id=repo_id, folder_path=repo_local_path, path_in_repo='.', ) print('Your model is pushed to the Hub. You can view your model here:', repo_url) With Transformers: python from transformers import PushToHubCallback # Initialize the callback with the output directory, tokenizer, and your Hub username and model name push_to_hub_callback = PushToHubCallback( output_dir='./your_model_save_path', tokenizer=tokenizer, hub_model_id='your-username/my-awesome-model' ) # Assuming `trainer` is your Trainer object trainer.add_callback(push_to_hub_callback) Using `timm`: python from timm.models.hub import push_to_hf_hub # Assuming `model` is your fine-tuned model model_cfg = {'labels': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']} push_to_hf_hub(model, 'resnet18-random', model_config=model_cfg) For computer vision models, you can also use `push_to_hub`: python processor.push_to_hub(hub_model_id) trainer.push_to_hub(**kwargs) You can also manually push a model with `model.push_to_hub()`: python model.push_to_hub() Additionally, you can opt to push your model to the Hub at the end of training by specifying `push_to_hub=True` in the training configuration. Don't forget to have git-lfs installed and be logged into your Hugging Face account.
## Agentic RAG vs. standard RAG
Does the agent setup make a better RAG system? Well, let’s comapre it to a standard RAG system using LLM Judge!
We will use meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct for evaluation since it’s one of the strongest OS models we tested for LLM judge use cases.
`eval_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("m-ric/huggingface_doc_qa_eval", split="train")`
Before running the test let’s make the agent less verbose.
```
import logging
agent.logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```
```
outputs_agentic_rag = []
for example in tqdm(eval_dataset):
question = example["question"]
enhanced_question = f"""Using the information contained in your knowledge base, which you can access with the 'retriever' tool,
give a comprehensive answer to the question below.
Respond only to the question asked, response should be concise and relevant to the question.
If you cannot find information, do not give up and try calling your retriever again with different arguments!
Make sure to have covered the question completely by calling the retriever tool several times with semantically different queries.
Your queries should not be questions but affirmative form sentences: e.g. rather than "How do I load a model from the Hub in bf16?", query should be "load a model from the Hub bf16 weights".
Question:
{question}"""
answer = agent.run(enhanced_question)
print("=======================================================")
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
print(f'True answer: {example["answer"]}')
results_agentic = {
"question": question,
"true_answer": example["answer"],
"source_doc": example["source_doc"],
"generated_answer": answer,
}
outputs_agentic_rag.append(results_agentic)
```
```
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient
reader_llm = InferenceClient("CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus")
outputs_standard_rag = []
for example in tqdm(eval_dataset):
question = example["question"]
context = retriever_tool(question)
prompt = f"""Given the question and supporting documents below, give a comprehensive answer to the question.
Respond only to the question asked, response should be concise and relevant to the question.
Provide the number of the source document when relevant.
If you cannot find information, do not give up and try calling your retriever again with different arguments!
Question:

{context}
"""
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
answer = reader_llm.chat_completion(messages).choices[0].message.content
print("=======================================================")
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
print(f'True answer: {example["answer"]}')
results_agentic = {
"question": question,
"true_answer": example["answer"],
"source_doc": example["source_doc"],
"generated_answer": answer,
}
outputs_standard_rag.append(results_agentic)
```
The evaluation prompt follows some of the best principles shown in our llm_judge cookbook: it follows a small integer Likert scale, has clear criteria, and a description for each score.
```
EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You are a fair evaluator language model.
You will be given an instruction, a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 3, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 3. You should refer to the score rubric.
3. The output format should look as follows: \"Feedback: {{write a feedback for criteria}} [RESULT] {{an integer number between 1 and 3}}\"
4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations. Be sure to include [RESULT] in your output.

 # Agentic RAG: Personalizing and Optimizing Knowledge-Augmented Language Models
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, despite their impressive performance, LLMs often face limitations such as hallucinations, temporal misalignments, and context processing issues [1]. To address these challenges, research has focused on enhancing LLMs by integrating them with external knowledge sources through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1].
RAG aims to improve the ability of language models to understand and generate accurate responses by retrieving and incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. By leveraging this additional context, RAG systems have demonstrated significant improvements in answering complex questions more accurately and contextually [1]. However, as the RAG framework has evolved and expanded, new challenges have emerged, particularly in the areas of retrieval quality, efficiency, and personalization.
To transcend these limitations, researchers have introduced ERAGent, a cutting-edge RAG framework that embodies significant advancements in the field [1]. ERAGent is designed to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and personalization of retrieval-augmented language models through the integration of several novel components and technologies.

 # RAG in 2024: The Evolution of AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval
*Editor’s note: Laurie Voss is a speaker for **ODSC West** this October 29th-31st. Be sure to check out his talk, “**RAG in 2024: Advancing to Agents**,” there!*
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing AI models with external knowledge. However, as we push the boundaries of what AI can do, we’re discovering that basic RAG has its limitations. While RAG is necessary, it’s not sufficient: we argue that advanced knowledge retrieval requires agentic strategies.
# Basic RAG
RAG works by combining a large language model with a knowledge base. When given a query, the system retrieves relevant information from its database and uses it to generate a response. This approach has proven incredibly useful for tasks that require up-to-date or specialized knowledge.
However, basic RAG systems struggle with more complex tasks. They often fall short when asked to:
- Summarize large documents: your query doesn’t match the whole document, you need software sufficiently aware of the task it was given to adapt with a different strategy
- Compare multiple pieces of information: a single retrieval is unlikely to get all the context you need
- Multi-part questions: queries like “what is the population of the largest city?” really require two questions — what’s the largest city, and what’s the population of that city?
# Advancing Beyond Basic RAG
To overcome these challenges, researchers and developers are taking two main approaches: enhancing data quality and increasing query sophistication. While improving data quality is crucial, the real game-changer is the introduction of agentic RAG systems.
Agentic RAG introduces the concept of AI agents — autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents go beyond simple retrieval and generation, incorporating advanced features that make them more flexible and powerful.
# Components of Agentic Systems
Agentic systems are built on several key components:
**Routing**: Agents can intelligently select the most appropriate tool or method to answer a query. For instance, a RouterQueryEngine can choose between different types of search or summarization tools based on the nature of the question.**Conversation Memory**: Unlike basic RAG, agentic systems can maintain context across multiple interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant responses.**Query Planning**: Complex queries are broken down into simpler sub-queries that can be processed in parallel, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate responses.**Tool Use**: Agents can interact with external APIs and data sources, adapting queries as needed. This allows them to access a wider range of information and perform actions beyond simple text generation.
# Agent Reasoning Strategies
Agentic systems employ various reasoning strategies to tackle complex tasks:
**Sequential Reasoning**: This includes approaches like the ReAct (Reasoning + Action) pattern, where the agent alternates between thinking about its next step and taking action.**DAG-based Reasoning**: The agent creates a comprehensive plan from start to finish, like a flowchart. It can also reflect on its progress and adjust the plan as needed.**Tree-based Reasoning**: For open-ended tasks, the agent explores multiple possible paths, balancing between exploring new options and exploiting promising leads.
# Advanced Features of Agentic Systems
Modern agentic systems also incorporate advanced features that enhance their usability and effectiveness:
**Observability**: Agents can be instrumented to provide insights into their decision-making processes, aiding in debugging and improvement.**Controllability**: Users can exert fine-grained control over agent actions, which is crucial for human-in-the-loop scenarios.**Customizability**: Agent behaviors can be modified and extended to suit specific use cases.
# AI Agents in LlamaIndex
To adapt to this new reality we have made agentic capabilities a first-class citizen in LlamaIndex: routing, memory, planning, and tool use are all key primitives in our library. Strategies for various types of reasoning are built-in while others are available as downloadable plug-ins from LlamaHub, our registry of open-source AI software. And observability, controllability, and customizability are all foundational to how our framework operates.
**In our talk at ODSC West**, we’ll be going in-depth into the problems that led to this evolution of knowledge retrieval and how we solved them, including step-by-step guides to building agents in the LlamaIndex framework itself. We hope to see you there!

 # Leveraging the Evolution of RAG in Enterprise Applications with Agentic RAG and Graph RAG
About a year ago, I shared my thoughts here on LinkedIn about a concept that the AI community calls "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG). ("Leveraging Generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Data" and "Unlocking the Potential of AI with Vector Databases and Embeddings").
Meanwhile, after 12 months, a lot has changed, the landscape has evolved significantly with the introduction of advanced strategies such as Agentic RAG and Graph RAG, and I think it's time for an update and a revised view that I want to share with you with this post.
If you have 10 minutes, let's look at how the initial RAG concept has evolved and why, and how the use of dynamic agents and graph relationships address the limitations of the basic RAG idea. And most importantly, what this means for business and enterprise applications and potential use case scenarios.
### Understanding the Limitations of Initial and Naive RAG Implementations
When I first looked into the RAG concept last year, it was in the context of building a customer-facing product recommendation system for one of our clients. The system was based on semantic analysis and deep product knowledge, to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses to user queries with the help of GenAI.
How to balance privacy and compliance concerns with measurable customer benefits while leveraging technologies like Generative AI has turned out to be quite a challenge. But that is for another post, how LLMOps and frameworks like ragas and Langfuse (YC W23) and concepts like "LLM as judge" can help.
Reminder #1: RAG works by retrieving relevant documents from a large set of (usually private) data and using these documents to guide the generation process of large language models (LLMs). The basic idea is to overcome the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as their tendency to generate factually inaccurate or irrelevant information.
Reminder #2: LLMs are like first-day interns: Smart and eager but know nothing about the person or company they’re working for. However, when an LLM has the required context, it will be able to provide meaningful answers.
Reminder #3: LLMs can act on data they've never seen before.
So much for the bare concept and initial idea; and it quickly turned out that the crucial part of "Retrieval Augmented Generation" is the "Retrieval" part and that there are some limitations associated to that.
The main limitation is that RAG relies heavily on semantic search for context retrieval. If you are interested in how this works and what role vector databases and embeddings play in this context, please read my post "Unlocking the Potential of AI with Vector Databases and Embeddings".
While this method is very impressive and can be effective to a degree, it often struggles to understand the deeper relationships between entities within the data which can lead to less accurate or contextually appropriate answers, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries that require a nuanced understanding of interrelated data points or when the task is to compare products or contents.
It's also relatively static, which means that this process lacks the ability to adapt dynamically to new contexts which can lead to suboptimal retrieval, especially in rapidly changing environments.
Integrating RAG with existing data silos which you usually see in enterprises and ensuring seamless access to various data sets can also be quite challenging, which results in incomplete and/or biased retrieval.
And then there's the critical issue of scalability as data volumes grow. The efficiency and speed of the retrieval process can decrease significantly, which makes it less practical for large-scale enterprise applications.
Realizing these limitations, the industry and researchers have meanwhile been working on more sophisticated approaches to improve the performance and applicability of RAG systems especially the retrieval step(s).
Let's look briefly into the two most promising (at least from my PoV) recent developments: Agentic RAG and Graph RAG.
### Agentic RAG: Extending RAG with Dynamic Agents
One of the most significant advances in RAG is Agentic RAG.
As the name suggests, Agentic RAG incorporates dynamic agents who are capable to execute specialized tasks in combination with dynamic prompt engineering and adaptive retrieval strategies.
Agents are designed to dynamically query databases, interpret results, dynamically search the Web, or query other sources. They clearly stand out by their advanced abilities to plan and reflect, consider context information, and utilize a wide range of tools.
In general, multi-agent systems represent a significant advancement over deterministic solutions, enabling the automation of more complex business processes.
If you want to dig deeper into this broader topic, I highly recommend taking some time to look at this presentation by my dear colleague André Koriath on how and where agent systems are particularly useful in a wider business and enterprise context.
Back to AgenticRAG: Imagine you're a detective working on a complex case. Instead of working alone, you have a team of specialized detectives (agents). One detective might focus on witness interviews, another on forensic evidence, and another on digital footprint analysis. They constantly share their findings with each other and refine their approach as new information emerges. This collaborative and adaptive approach allows for a more complete understanding of the case and ultimately leads to more accurate and insightful conclusions. And this is exactly how AgenticRAG works: It uses dynamic agents to continuously improve the accuracy and relevance of the information it retrieves and processes.
AgenticRAG is highly dynamic and supports goal-driven task execution which is significantly different compared to traditional RAG systems.
Good examples of typical agents are database query agents, document parsing agents that extract key insights from different documents, and real-time monitoring agents to update context but also to search the web.
Frameworks like the Llama-Agents framework (by LlamaIndex ) even support the creation of asynchronous agents and provide tools to deploy them as autonomous microservices, which can be of significant help when building highly modular and scalable systems.
### Graph RAG: Leveraging Graph-Based Relationships
Graph RAG, recently introduced by Microsoft , on the other hand, addresses some of the weaknesses of Baseline RAG in a very different way. The key idea is to also integrate graph-based data structures during the retrieval process and to utilize the relationships between certain entities.
This method goes way beyond basic semantic search and maps entities that are related, which leads to a richer and more contextually accurate data set for the LLM.
Imagine a library where books are not only organized by genre or author, but also connected by thematic threads, references, and common concepts. Now imagine a librarian (Graph RAG) who can not only find books directly related to the question or request of the person who entered the library, but also uncover connections to other relevant materials, leading to a deeper and richer understanding of the topic, which is handed over to a storyteller (LLM) to answer the original question in plain English.
### Differences and potential business applications
Now let's briefly compare both concepts to each other.
While both Agentic RAG and Graph RAG aim to improve and enhance the initial RAG process, they focus on very different aspects.
AgenticRAG provides dynamic and specialized task execution, making it ideal for environments where real-time, context-specific data retrieval is critical. This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where immediate and accurate responses are required, such as customer support or financial analysis.
On the other hand, Graph RAG is unique in its ability to understand and exploit complex data relationships. By mapping the intricate connections between data points, Graph RAG can provide way deeper and more contextual answers. This makes it invaluable for applications that require deep contextual insights, such as knowledge management and research and development.
### Conclusion
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) came to stay, it's (still) an amazing concept.
The evolution from initial RAG to advanced concepts like Agentic RAG and Graph RAG marks a significant leap in how we can leverage generative AI for enterprise applications in a secure and compliant way.
By overcoming the limitations of early RAG implementations, these new strategies deliver much more accurate, contextually relevant, and actionable insights, and provide a great foundation for many applications that help businesses transform the way they operate, make decisions, and create real customer value.

 Time series modeling is vital across many fields, including demand planning, anomaly detection, and weather forecasting, but it faces challenges like high dimensionality, non-linearity, and distribution shifts. While traditional methods rely on task-specific neural network designs, there is potential for adapting foundational small-scale pretrained language models (SLMs) for universal time series applications. However, SLMs, primarily trained on text, may need help with continuous time series data and patterns like seasonality. Recent approaches, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enhance models with external knowledge, offering new possibilities for improving time series analysis and complex goal-oriented tasks.
Researchers from IIT Dharwad and TCS Research propose an agentic RAG framework for time series analysis using a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture. A master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents, each fine-tuned with SLMs for specific time series tasks like forecasting or anomaly detection. These sub-agents retrieve relevant prompts from specialized knowledge repositories, or prompt pools, that store historical patterns, enabling better predictions on new data. This modular approach enhances flexibility and accuracy, outperforming traditional methods across various time series tasks by effectively addressing complex challenges.
The proposed method introduces a framework for time series analysis, utilizing a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where a master agent coordinates specialized sub-agents focused on tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation. These sub-agents leverage pre-trained language models and employ a dynamic prompting mechanism to retrieve relevant prompts from an internal knowledge base. This mechanism allows the model to adapt to various trends within complex time series data by accessing historical patterns stored as key-value pairs in a shared prompt pool. The dynamic prompting approach overcomes the limitations of traditional fixed-window methods by enabling the model to adjust to different trends and patterns, enhancing the accuracy of predictions across diverse time series tasks.
Additionally, the framework builds upon recent advancements in SLMs by incorporating a two-tiered attention mechanism to handle long-range dependencies in time series data. The method improves the processing of long sequences without fine-tuning. Still, it also leverages instruction-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to enhance SLM performance on specific time series tasks. This includes improving the context length of SLMs to 32K tokens, enabling them to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the framework utilizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune SLMs, ensuring that the models favor more accurate task-specific outcomes, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of time series analysis.
The proposed Agentic-RAG framework was evaluated across the forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation tasks. It employed variants like SelfExtend-Gemma-2B-instruct, Gemma-7B-instruct, and Llama 3-8B-instruct. Real-world traffic datasets (e.g., PeMS, METR-LA) and multivariate anomaly detection datasets (e.g., SWaT, NASA telemetry) were used. Evaluation metrics included MAE, RMSE, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The framework consistently outperformed baselines in forecasting tasks, especially on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and robustness across all metrics.
In conclusion, The Agentic RAG framework, proposed for time series analysis, addresses challenges like distribution shifts and fixed-length subsequences. It employs a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture with specialized sub-agents for different tasks. These sub-agents use prompt pools as knowledge bases, retrieving relevant information to enhance predictions on new data. The modular design allows the framework to outperform traditional methods in handling complex time series tasks. Using SLMs within this framework enables flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series benchmarks.

This advanced technique combines the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with autonomous agents, offering a more dynamic and context-aware method to process and generate information. As businesses and researchers seek to enhance their AI capabilities, understanding and implementing Agentic RAG has become crucial to staying ahead in the competitive landscape.
This guide delves into the intricacies of mastering Agentic RAG using two powerful tools: LangChain and CrewAI. It explores the evolution from traditional RAG to its agentic counterpart, highlighting the key differences and benefits. The article also examines how LangChain serves as the foundation for implementing Agentic RAG and demonstrates the ways CrewAI can be leveraged to create more sophisticated and efficient AI systems.
## The Evolution of RAG: From Traditional to Agentic
### Limitations of traditional RAG
Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized AI by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases to overcome off-the-shelf LLM limitations. However, these systems face challenges while multi-tasking and are not suitable for complex use cases. It is okay until you are building simple Q&A chatbot, support bots, etc but as soon the things get a little complex, the traditional RAG approach fails. They often struggle with contextualizing retrieved data, leading to superficial responses that may not fully address query nuances.
## Introducing Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG emerges as an evolution of traditional RAG, integrating AI agents to enhance the RAG approach. This approach employs autonomous agents to analyze initial findings and strategically select effective tools for data retrieval. These AI agents have the capability to breakdown the complex task into several subtasks so it becomes easy to handle. They also possess the memory (like chat history) so they know what has happened and what steps needs to be taken further.
Also, these AI agents are so smart they can call any API or tool whenever there is a requirement to solve the tasks. The agents can come up with logic, reasoning and take actions accordingly. This is what makes an agentic RAG approach so prominent. The system deconstructs complex queries into manageable segments, assigning specific agents to each part while maintaining seamless coordination.
### Key benefits and use cases of Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG offers numerous advantages over traditional systems. Its autonomous agents work independently, allowing for efficient handling of complex queries in parallel. The system's adaptability enables dynamic adjustment of strategies based on new information or evolving user needs. In marketing, Agentic RAG can analyze customer data to generate personalized communications and provide real-time competitive intelligence. It also enhances decision-making in campaign management and improves search engine optimization strategies.

# Title:Searching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have proven to be effective in integrating up-to-date information, mitigating hallucinations, and enhancing response quality, particularly in specialized domains. While many RAG approaches have been proposed to enhance large language models through query-dependent retrievals, these approaches still suffer from their complex implementation and prolonged response times. Typically, a RAG workflow involves multiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here, we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that multimodal retrieval techniques can significantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and accelerate the generation of multimodal content using a "retrieval as generation" strategy.

environments, leading to more effective decision-making and task completion.
Various usage patterns of Agentic RAG
7. 7/17
Agents within a RAG framework exhibit various usage patterns, each tailored to specific
tasks and objectives. These usage patterns showcase the versatility and adaptability of
agents in interacting with RAG systems. Below are the key usage patterns of agents
within a RAG context:
1. Utilizing an existing RAG pipeline as a tool:
Agents can employ pre-existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks
or generate outputs. By utilizing established pipelines, agents can streamline their
operations and leverage the capabilities already present within the RAG framework.
2. Functioning as a standalone RAG tool:
Agents can function autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This allows
agents to generate responses independently based on input queries without relying
on external tools or pipelines.
3. Dynamic tool retrieval based on query context:
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index,
based on the context provided by the query at query time. This tool retrieval enables
agents to adapt their actions based on the specific requirements of each query.
4. Query planning across existing tools:
Agents are equipped to perform query planning tasks by analyzing input queries
and selecting suitable tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG
system. This allows agents to optimize the selection of tools based on the query
requirements and desired outcomes.
5. Selection of tools from the candidate pool:
In situations where the RAG system offers a wide array of tools, agents can help
choose the most suitable one from the pool of candidate tools retrieved according to
the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool aligns closely with
the query context and objectives.
These usage patterns can be combined and customized to create complex RAG
applications tailored to specific use cases and requirements. Through harnessing these
patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various
tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG
framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and
functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and
manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional
tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
1. Query/Prompt: The user’s input query or prompt.
8. 8/17
2. Retriever: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve
relevant information related to the query.
3. Knowledge base: The external data source containing the information to be
retrieved.
4. Large Language Model (LLM): A powerful language model that generates an
output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this
pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG
framework:
1. Query understanding and decomposition
Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its
intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively
handled by the RAG pipeline.
For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments
in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken
down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in
quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum
computing for cybersecurity.”
2. Knowledge base management
Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring
data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised
information.
Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the
knowledge base for a given query or task.
3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword
matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance,
considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements,
and available computational resources.
4. Result synthesis and post-processing
After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-
process the result.
This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving
inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-
structured.
9. 9/17
Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific
knowledge to enhance the output further.
5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide
feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge
base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
6. Task orchestration and coordination
For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate
and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different
components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
7. Multimodal integration
Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images,
videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation
capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple
modalities.
8. Continuous learning and adaptation
Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement,
and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or
adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback,
performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more
flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning,
decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents
act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and
performance of the RAG pipeline.
Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of
capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can
serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason +
act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
Routing agent
10. 10/17
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which
downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein
the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most
suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic
reasoning.
Query Agent Router Response

RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the
summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.

RAG : Summary Query Engine RAG : Vector Query Engine Tools LeewayHertz LLM
One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of
which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources.
The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response.
Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into
subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the
results into a comprehensive response.

In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that
semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is
required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with
an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before
it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.

query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling
12. 12/17
sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves
the following steps:
1. Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to
utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
2. The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
3. The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and,
based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
4. This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.

Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing
necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in
production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability,
observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a
requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency
reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-
term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
1. Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the
entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
2. Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform
them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically
utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user
query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to
accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire
plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

**Industry**: Corporate**Service**: Analytics, Data Science and AI**Type**:**Blog**
We are all familiar with **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** by now. RAG is a framework designed to enhance text quality by integrating relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge base into the generated content. By combining retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities, RAG produces more accurate, contextually appropriate, and informative text, significantly improving the overall results.
Recently, Agentic RAG has emerged as a new and powerful AI technique. In this blog, we’ll examine the problems with traditional RAG, then dive into the next advancement in the field of large language models (LLM)—agentic RAG—and explore its features and benefits.
A typical RAG pipeline involves:
- Data Indexing
- User Query
- Retrieval & Generation
**Problems with Traditional RAG:**
**Summarization issues:**Summarizing large documents can be tricky. The traditional RAG framework retrieves the top K chunks and may miss crucial information if the document is extensive.**Document comparison challenges:**Comparing documents effectively is still a hurdle. The RAG framework tends to pull random top K chunks from each document, often leading to an incomplete comparison.**Structured data analysis needs:**Handling structured data queries, such as determining an employee's next leave based on their region, proves to be a challenge. Accurate retrieval and analysis of specific data points aren't spot-on.**Dealing with multi-part questions:**Tackling multi-part questions remains a limitation. For instance, identifying common leave patterns across all regions in a large organization is difficult when constrained to K chunks, which limits comprehensive analysis.
**Now, to overcome these limitations, Agentic RAG comes to the rescue**. Agentic RAG = Agent-based RAG implementation
**Beyond Traditional RAG: Adding Agentic Layers**
Agentic RAG revolutionizes the way questions are answered by introducing an agent-based framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), Agentic RAG employs intelligent agents to tackle complex questions that require:
- Intricate planning
- Multi-step reasoning
- Utilization of external tools
These agents act like expert researchers, adeptly navigating multiple documents, comparing information, generating summaries, and delivering comprehensive and accurate answers. It’s like having a team of specialists working collaboratively to meet your information needs. Whether you need to compare perspectives across documents or synthesize information from various sources, Agentic RAG agents are equipped to handle the task with precision and efficiency.
**Why Agentic RAG?**
An AI agent is essential for:
**Reasoning:**Determining which actions to take and their sequence.**Task Management:**Using agents instead of LLMs directly for tasks requiring planning, multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and learning over time.
In the context of RAG:
- Agents enhance reasoning before selecting RAG pipelines.
- Improve retrieval or re-ranking processes within a pipeline.
- Optimize synthesis before responding.
This approach automates complex workflows and decision-making for non-trivial RAG use cases.
**Agentic RAG Benefits:**
**Orchestrated question answering:**Breaks down the process into manageable steps, assigns appropriate agents, and ensures seamless coordination for optimal results.**Goal-driven:**Agents understand and pursue specific goals, allowing for more complex and meaningful interactions.**Planning and reasoning:**Agents can determine the best strategies for information retrieval, analysis, and synthesis to answer complex questions effectively.**Tool use and adaptability:**Agents leverage external tools and resources, such as search engines, databases, and specialized APIs, to enhance their information-gathering and processing capabilities.**Context-aware:**Systems consider the current situation, past interactions, and user preferences to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.**Learning over time:**Agents are designed to learn and improve, expanding their knowledge base and enhancing their ability to tackle complex questions.**Flexibility and customization:**The framework provides exceptional flexibility, allowing customization to suit specific requirements and domains.**Improved accuracy and efficiency:**By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and agent-based systems, agentic RAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in question answering.
RAG Agents can be categorized based on their functions, including ** routing, one-shot query planning, tool use, Reason + Act (ReAct), and dynamic planning & execution**. These functions vary in complexity, cost, and latency and range from simple, low-cost, low-latency tasks to complex, high-cost, high-latency operations.
For example:
**Routing Agents (aka Routers):**The routing agent relies on an LLM to select the appropriate downstream RAG pipeline. This process is known as agentic reasoning, since the LLM analyzes the input query to determine the best-fit RAG pipeline. It represents the most straightforward form of this type of reasoning.
One scenario may involve choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to route it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine.
**Query Planning Agent**: It simplifies a complex query by dividing it into smaller, parallelizable sub-queries. Each sub-query can be executed across various RAG pipelines that are linked to different data sources. The individual responses from these pipelines are combined to form the final response.
In essence, the process involves breaking down the query into manageable parts, executing them across suitable RAG pipelines, and finally merging the results into a coherent response.
Several other flows are there based on the functionalities and use cases.
Agentic RAG represents a significant advancement in the field of large language models. By incorporating custom agents that can interact with multiple systems, automate reasoning, and dynamically select the best tools for the task at hand, Agentic RAG addresses the shortcomings of traditional RAG. This makes it a more effective solution for handling complex queries and a wider range of use cases.

 # Agentic RAG: A Reasoning Revolution for Information Retrieval
### Introduction
Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a game-changer for large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and process external knowledge as an alternative to fine-tuning. But what if we could push this concept even further? Enter Agentic RAG, a powerful reasoning system that builds upon traditional RAG to deliver more accurate and relevant responses.
This article explores the core concepts of both Traditional and Agentic RAG, highlighting their differences, advantages, and providing practical examples to illustrate their application.
### Traditional RAG: A Workhorse for Information Retrieval
How Traditional RAG Works
Traditional RAG operates on a straightforward principle:
This process can be visualized as feeding the LLM relevant snippets to help it understand the context and formulate a more accurate response.
Limitations of Traditional RAG
Despite its effectiveness, Traditional RAG has several limitations:
### Enter Agentic RAG: The Reasoning Agent
Agentic RAG introduces a critical element – the "agent." This agent acts as an intelligent intermediary between the user and the LLM, enhancing the process through reasoning and task-specific routing.
How Agentic RAG Works
Example 1: Single Document Q&A
Imagine a user asks, "Summarize this document." In Traditional RAG, if the question is vague, the system might retrieve and summarize chunks of the document that match the question, potentially missing the user's true intent. For instance, if the document is about a company's financial report, the system might focus on sections mentioning profits without providing a holistic summary.
## Recommended by LinkedIn
In contrast, Agentic RAG first determines the intent—is the user asking for a summary, a comparison, or specific details? It then routes the question to the appropriate agent:
Example 2: Multi-Document Q&A
Consider a scenario where a user asks, "Compare the policies of Company A and Company B." This complex query involves multiple documents:
- Extract key points from both documents.
- Identify similarities and differences.
- Formulate a comprehensive comparative response.
Benefits of Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG offers several key advantages over Traditional RAG:
### Addressing Context and Latency Concerns
A common question is why we need RAG when some models allow for larger context sizes. While larger context windows can handle more information, they come with increased latency and cost. Sending a 200-page document to an LLM is inefficient and still limited by the response token limit (e.g., 4096 tokens). Agentic RAG mitigates this by focusing on the most relevant information, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution.
### Conclusion
Agentic RAG represents a significant evolution in information retrieval, introducing reasoning and intent recognition to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses. By leveraging specialized agents and multi-step processing, it overcomes the limitations of Traditional RAG, paving the way for more sophisticated and nuanced AI interactions. As the field continues to evolve, Agentic RAG promises to unlock the true potential of large language models, providing users with deeper, more meaningful insights.

**Diverse Applications of Agentic Reinforcement Learning**
Within a RAG framework, agents display diverse usage patterns tailored to specific tasks and objectives. These patterns highlight the agents’ adaptability and versatility when interacting with RAG systems. Key usage patterns of agents in an RAG context include:
-
**Employing Pre-existing RAG Pipelines as Tools**
Agents can leverage existing RAG pipelines as tools to accomplish specific tasks or produce outputs. By utilizing these established pipelines, agents can simplify their operations and benefit from the capabilities inherent in the RAG framework.
-
**Functioning Independently as RAG Tools:**
Agents can operate autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This autonomy allows agents to generate responses independently based on input queries, without relying on external tools or pipelines.
-
**Dynamic Tool Retrieval Based on Query Context:**
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index, based on the context provided by a query at query time. This tool retrieval enables agents to adapt their actions according to the unique requirements of each query.
-
**Query Planning Across Existing Tools:**
Agents can analyze input queries and select appropriate tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This query planning enables agents to optimize tool selection based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.
-
**Selecting Tools from the Candidate Pool:**
When the RAG system offers a wide range of tools, agents can assist in selecting the most suitable one from the candidate tools retrieved based on the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool closely aligns with the query context and objectives.
Within a RAG framework, agents can leverage these usage patterns to execute various tasks effectively. By combining and customizing these patterns, complex RAG applications can be tailored to meet specific use cases and requirements. Harnessing these patterns enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system, enabling agents to accomplish their tasks seamlessly.
**RAG Agents Categorized by Functionality:**
RAG agents can be classified into distinct categories based on their functional capabilities. This spectrum of capabilities ranges from simple to complex, resulting in varying costs and latency. These agents can fulfill diverse roles such as routing, planning one-time queries, employing tools, utilizing ReAct (Reason + Act) methodology, and coordinating dynamic planning and execution.
**1. Routing Agent**
The routing agent makes use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to choose the best downstream retrieval augmented generation RAG pipeline. This decision-making process involves agentic reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the input query. This allows it to select the most appropriate RAG pipeline. This process exemplifies the core and basic form of agentic reasoning.
When determining the best routing for a query, two options arise: using a summarization retrieval augmented generation pipeline or a question-answering RAG pipeline. The agent analyzes the input query to ascertain whether it should be directed to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both of which are configured as tools.
**2. One-Shot Query Planning Agent**
In query planning, a complex query is decomposed into smaller, parallelizable subqueries. These subqueries are then executed across various RAG pipelines, each utilizing different data sources. The responses obtained from these pipelines are amalgamated to form the final comprehensive response. This process involves breaking down the query, executing the subqueries across suitable pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a cohesive response.

**3. Tool Use Agent**
In a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that align semantically with the query. However, there are situations where additional information is necessary from external sources, such as APIs, SQL databases, or applications with API interfaces. This additional data acts as contextual input to enrich the initial query before it undergoes processing by the Large Language Model (LLM). In such scenarios, the agent can also leverage a RAG model.
**4. ReAct Agent**
ReAct: Integrating Reasoning and Actions with LLMs
Elevating to a more advanced level requires the incorporation of reasoning and actions executed iteratively for complex queries. This essentially consolidates routing, query planning, and tool utilization into a single entity. A ReAct agent capably handles sequential, multi-part queries while maintaining an in-memory state. The process unfolds as follows:
- Upon receiving a user query, the agent identifies the suitable tool (if needed) and gathers its necessary input.
- The selected tool is invoked with the input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then retrieves the tool’s history, encompassing both input and output. Based on this information, it decides the next course of action.
- This iterative process continues until the agent concludes tasks and responds to the user.
**5. Dynamic Planning & Execution Agent**
The most widely adopted agent is currently ReAct, but there is a growing need to handle more complex user intents. As more agents are deployed in production environments, there is an increasing demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. This necessitates long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At their core, these efforts aim to separate high-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the steps necessary to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating a computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Identifying the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and performing them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. The executor then executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.
**How to Implement Agentic RAG?**
Constructing an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation necessitates specialized frameworks and tools that streamline the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Although building such a system from the ground up can be intricate, there are several existing alternatives that can simplify the implementation process. In this regard, let’s delve into some potential avenues.

# 1. Introduction
As usual, I helped my daughter with her Chinese homework during this weekend. I discovered a poem that beautifully mirrors the evolving generative AI agent. The poem titled “人有两件宝” or “We Each Have Two Treasures,” elegantly reflected the essence of the large language model Agent concept at its core. The poem speaks of two treasures every person possesses: our hands and brains.
Our hands represent the ability to **act** — to manipulate tools, craft objects, moving things. Our brains symbolize the capacity for **thought, reasoning, planning, reflection, and Memory.**
The duality of action and reflection is fundamental in Generative AI agent technologies, much like using hands and brains described in my daughter’s Chinese poem:
“If hands alone should do a task,
Without some thought, it’s too much to ask.
And brains alone, if they’re all we use,
Without our hands, what good are clues?
But use them both, together, strong,
In harmony, they can’t go wrong.

## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

Agentic RAG is a powerful tool for research, data analysis, and knowledge exploration. Its ability to reason, adapt, and leverage external knowledge paves the way for a new generation of intelligent agents that can significantly enhance our ability to interact with and analyse information. Let’s understand it in detail.
### What is Agentic RAG?
“Agentic RAG = Agent-based RAG implementation”
To visualize Agentic RAG, suppose you are a researcher. Think of it as having a team of expert researchers at your disposal, each with unique skills and capabilities, working collaboratively to address your information needs.
Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on large language models (#LLMs), agentic RAG employs intelligent agents to tackle complex questions requiring intricate planning, multi-step reasoning, and utilization of external tools. These agents act as skilled researchers, adeptly navigating multiple documents, comparing information, generating summaries, and delivering comprehensive and accurate answers.
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of Naive RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
“Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents”
In a Naive RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
Query/Prompt: User input query or prompt.
Retriever: Searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.
Knowledge base: Contains the information to be retrieved.
Large Language Model (LLM): Generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In A-RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here is a detailed explanationof how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
By integrating these agents, agentic RAG systems become more flexible and adaptable, capable of handling complex tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and coordination. Agents enhance the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
### Types of Agentic RAG
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency.
Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyses the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can be utilized.
ReAct agent
A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory).
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
The process involves the following steps:
1. Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
2. The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
3. The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
4. This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
Dynamic planning & execution agent
As the deployment of complex AI systems in production environment increases, there is a demand for enhanced planning, reliability, and transparency. This agent provides long-term planning, execution insights, optimization, and latency reduction by:
How to implement A-RAG
Building A-RAG requires specific frameworks and tools that facilitate the creation and coordination of multiple agents. Let’s see the most popular frameworks used to build them:
LlamaIndex
It is a robust framework that empowers developers to create agents, oversee agent interactions, and implement advanced reasoning mechanisms. It comes with pre-built tools which facilitate interactions with diverse data sources, and integration with data bases including vector databases. It helps in chaining different tools and tools to create intricate workflows, and its memory component aids in tracking agent actions and dialogue history.
LangChain
Like LlamaIndex, LangChain provides a comprehensive toolkit for constructing agent-based systems and orchestrating interactions between them. Its array of tools seamlessly integrates with external resources within LangChain’s ecosystem, enabling agents to access a wide range of functionalities, including search, database management, and code execution.
### Challenges in agentic RAG
As AI advances, agentic RAG systems have become powerful tools for generating intelligent responses from diverse sources. However, challenges and opportunities remain:
### Conclusion
The emergence of A-RAG marks a significant advancement in the Naïve RAG framework. By integrating agentic capabilities, researchers are developing intelligent systems capable of reasoning over retrieved information, executing multi-step actions, and synthesizing insights from diverse sources. The adaptive nature of these systems, which dynamically select tools and tailor responses based on initial findings, opens avenues for diverse applications.
As research progresses in this domain, we anticipate the development of even more refined agents, blurring the boundaries between human and machine intelligence and propelling us toward deeper knowledge and understanding.

### Result85:
 **One of the fastest growing use cases for LLMs is RAG, or retrieval augmented generation.** In this use case, the context window of an LLM is enhanced with grounded content (like search results, meeting transcriptions, etc), and then the LLM is able to generate a succinct summary.
Combined with use of LLMs for embeddings and retrieval, this has breathed a new life in RAG use cases, especially search.
However, we are now beginning to understand how **RAG architecture has scaling challenges.** The belief was that if you give vast amounts of data to an LLM, it will be able to sort through it and provide correct results.
Unfortunately, this is turning out to be a problem. We often hear of customers who run into poor results as they add multiple data sources into an existing RAG based search tool. These poor results often show irrelevant or low quality results, even when higher quality and more relevant content is available.
Let me explain by an example. Let’s say I am a salesperson and I want to find information about an opportunity. I have connected my copilot or assistant to a diverse set of sources — from CRM, email, calendar, Slack, Google Drive, etc.
When I ask about the status of an opportunity, a basic RAG-based search engine does not have any insight about where to go — and which source to trust. What if I want to know about the most recent updates on an opportunity. What if I want to find out when an opportunity would close? What if I want to find out when I am meeting a customer next?
As you can tell, a RAG-based architecture will return an unpredictable and generally unreliable set of results. It might highlight results from an email when I ask about the status of an opportunity instead of CRM, or it might highlight results from Slack if I ask about the health of a customer instead of Gainsight . It might go to CRM for the most recent update on an opportunity when it should probably go to Slack or Teams.
You get the point, the chief weakness in this architecture is that a RAG system does not have any ability to decide which content system is the preferred store of certain kinds of content.
To fully appreciate the advancements in agentic RAG, it’s crucial to understand the foundations of retrieval augmented generation. Let’s examine the core principles and mechanics of basic RAG systems.
## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?
Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an architectural approach that enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. This method allows LLMs to access and incorporate up-to-date information beyond their initial training data.
The basic RAG process consists of the following components:
A pre-trained language model serving as the base architecture
An external knowledge base containing relevant, current information
A retrieval mechanism to access pertinent data from the knowledge base
An augmentation process that incorporates retrieved information into the model's generation pipeline
**This is to say that RAG helps AI give more accurate and up-to-date answers.** This architecture enables LLMs to generate responses that are both linguistically coherent and factually grounded in current, domain-specific knowledge.
Importantly, RAG is why various AI tools can now use your company's data to answer questions. They can look at things like chat messages, customer info, and even obscure, old reports to find the answers you're looking for. As a result of this technique — search got smarter. Chatbots became genuinely helpful. The AI world took notice, and RAG applications exploded.
But RAG isn't perfect yet. It's still new and has some problems. We're working on making it even better.
## The problem with basic RAG
In short, RAG systems are having trouble with too much data. Many companies thought just adding more info would make AI smarter. But that's proving to be counterproductive.
**The main issue is that RAG can't easily decide what's important in all this data.** Increasing the volume of data doesn't equate to improved intelligence; instead, it's like searching for a needle in a haystack by adding more hay. This is to say that when companies connect many data sources to their RAG tool, they often get bad answers, even when good info is there.
For example: I’m a salesperson and I want to find information about an opportunity. My AI-powered copilot can look in many places — sales records, emails, calendars, chat messages, and files.
**But this RAG-based search system doesn't know where to look first or which source to trust.** What if I want to know about the most recent updates on an opportunity? What if I want to find out when an opportunity would close? What if I want to find out when I am meeting a customer next? It might pull information from an email instead of CRM or from Notion instead of Gainsight, leading to unpredictable and generally unreliable results.
Basic RAG often misses the best information. It might ignore expert knowledge and use less reliable sources instead. I've witnessed numerous instances where customers realize their sophisticated RAG tool is producing subpar results, despite having access to the best, most up-to-date information. This isn't merely frustrating — it can be potentially harmful in critical business scenarios.
**The fundamental issue is that RAG alone can't choose the best place to look for specific questions.** It's not smart enough to understand the context of what it's looking for. Basic RAG is reaching its limits. Just adding more data isn't the answer. We need a smarter way that not only finds info but also comprehends and contextualizes it.
## How agentic AI makes RAG better
Basic RAG has problems when there's too much data. Agentic AI can help fix this.
Agentic AI adds a "reasoner" to RAG. The reasoner doesn't just pull data; it understands the nuances of the person asking, including the question itself and the context.
In a basic RAG system, there’s no clear plan for why certain data is retrieved. **Agentic RAG creates a purpose-driven approach to retrieval.**
Here's what the reasoner does:
It guesses what the user really wants based on their identity
It makes a plan to find and use the right information
It uses context to understand the relative importance and reliability of various data sources
For example, if someone asks about a recent sales update, the reasoner might prioritize real-time communication tools like Slack or Teams over more static sources like CRM entries. This helps find newer, more useful information.
The reasoner also checks if the information is good before showing it to the user. It tries to use the best sources and avoid unreliable ones.
This means:
- You get more current and relevant answers
- The AI is less likely to use old or wrong information
- You see better results, even when there's lots of data to search through
It’s important to note that agentic RAG can also change its plan if needed. If it doesn’t find good information in one place, it looks somewhere else. If it queries the CRM and finds no recent updates, it can pivot to other sources like call notes or project management tools. This adaptability ensures that users get the most pertinent information available.
Even more crucially, **agentic RAG doesn’t just find data — it gets it ready to use. **This might mean:
- Translating
- Doing math
- Verifying information
And that’s where agentic “skills” really come into focus.
The generative nature of agentic RAG grants it the ability to independently problem solve. Agentic RAG can sequence and chain together multiple generative actions on its own or within the systems its retrieving information from.
Simply put, **agentic RAG can take action on its own**. It can even do complex tasks by breaking them into smaller steps.
Let’s go back to another sales example. Imagine that same rep has progressed their deal and is working to close that opportunity they’ve been working. A RAG solution could point them toward sourcing the documents and process descriptions of quote creation. An agentic RAG solution, however, would be capable of drafting that quote with the specifics of that user’s specified account.
The plan might encompass creating a quote draft from the standard quoting template. It also fills in the standard deal fields from CRM data. Baseline costs are generated from the information contained within the most recent pricebook. Let’s also imagine the rep wants to add a discount to the prospect to sweeten the deal — they instruct it to apply a certain percentage discount and AI is capable of calculating and adjusting that quote. Notably, each of these seemingly simple tasks requires multiple steps to achieve.
This is very different from basic RAG. Agentic RAG can do many useful things all at once, making it much more helpful for users.
## Upleveling the Moveworks Copilot’s architecture with agentic AI
At Moveworks, our vision for our Copilot was to create a system that truly understands and anticipates user needs. In our architecture, when a user poses a question, the Copilot seamlessly breaks down the process into clear, effective steps:
**Understand user goals:**The Copilot starts by comprehending the user's query and goals, ensuring it grasps the intent behind the request.**Plan function calls**: Next, it strategically plans the necessary function calls required to achieve the user's goals. This step involves mapping out which systems and data sources are best suited to provide the most relevant answers.**Execute relevant function calls**: The Copilot then executes these function calls across the targeted systems, retrieving precise information from each source.**Rank and summarize results**: Finally, it ranks and summarizes the results obtained, presenting the user with a concise and prioritized overview that directly addresses their query.
We’ve found that an agentic RAG approach not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts the quality of results delivered by our Copilot. By integrating agentic AI into our architecture, Moveworks ensures that users receive accurate, contextually aware responses tailored to their specific needs.
## It’s time for a smarter approach: Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG is a big step forward from basic RAG. At Moveworks, we’ve seen firsthand how agentic RAG is smarter. Its architecture is set up to think about what information is really needed and take next steps.
Our Copilot doesn’t just surface a lot of data; it finds the right data for each specific question. And this helps businesses make better decisions faster.
Agentics RAG does more than just save time; it changes how AI helps people work. As companies deal with more complex information, we will continue to improve our AI. Our agentic RAG approach shows how we are making AI that really helps people do their jobs better.

or generate outputs. By utilizing established pipelines, agents can streamline their
operations and leverage the capabilities already present within the RAG framework.
2. Functioning as a standalone RAG tool:
Agents can function autonomously as RAG tools within the framework. This allows
agents to generate responses independently based on input queries without relying
on external tools or pipelines.
3. Dynamic tool retrieval based on query context:
Agents can retrieve relevant tools from the RAG system, such as a vector index,
based on the context provided by the query at query time. This tool retrieval enables
agents to adapt their actions based on the specific requirements of each query.
4. Query planning across existing tools:

and selecting suitable tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG
system. This allows agents to optimize the selection of tools based on the query
requirements and desired outcomes.
5. Selection of tools from the candidate pool:
In situations where the RAG system offers a wide array of tools, agents can help
choose the most suitable one from the pool of candidate tools retrieved according to
the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool aligns closely with
the query context and objectives.
These usage patterns can be combined and customized to create complex RAG
applications tailored to specific use cases and requirements. Through harnessing these
patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various
tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG
framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and
functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and
manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional
tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
1. Query/Prompt: The user’s input query or prompt.
8. 8/17
2. Retriever: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve
relevant information related to the query.
3. Knowledge base: The external data source containing the information to be
retrieved.
4. Large Language Model (LLM): A powerful language model that generates an
output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this
pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG
framework:
1. Query understanding and decomposition
Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its
intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively
handled by the RAG pipeline.
For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments
in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken
down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in
quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum
computing for cybersecurity.”
2. Knowledge base management
Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring
data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised
information.
Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the
knowledge base for a given query or task.
3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword
matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance,
considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements,
and available computational resources.
4. Result synthesis and post-processing
After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-
process the result.
This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving
inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-
structured.
9. 9/17
Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific
knowledge to enhance the output further.
5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide
feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge
base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
6. Task orchestration and coordination
For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate
and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different
components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
7. Multimodal integration
Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images,
videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation
capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple
modalities.
8. Continuous learning and adaptation
Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement,
and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or
adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback,
performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more
flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning,
decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents
act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and
performance of the RAG pipeline.
Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of
capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can
serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason +
act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
Routing agent
10. 10/17
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which
downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein
the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most
suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic
reasoning.
Query Agent Router Response

RAG : Query Engine B Tools LLM LeewayHertz An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering
RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the
summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.

RAG : Summary Query Engine RAG : Vector Query Engine Tools LeewayHertz LLM
One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of
which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources.
The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response.
Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into
subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the
results into a comprehensive response.

In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that
semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is
required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with
an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before
it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.

query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling
12. 12/17
sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves
the following steps:
1. Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to
utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
2. The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
3. The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and,
based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
4. This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.

Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing
necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in
production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability,
observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a
requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency
reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-
term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
1. Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the
entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
2. Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform
them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically
utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user
query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to
accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire
plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

### Result90:
 Retrieval Augmented Generation systems, better known as RAG systems, have quickly become popular for building Generative AI assistants on custom enterprise data. They avoid the hassles of expensive fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). One of the key advantages of RAG systems is you can easily integrate your data, augment your LLM’s intelligence, and give more contextual answers to your questions. However, a whole set of problems can make RAG systems underperform and, worse, give wrong answers to your questions! In this guide, we will look at a way to see how AI Agents can augment the capabilities of a traditional RAG system and improve on some of its limitations.
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system architecture typically consists of two major steps:
In Step 1, Data Processing and Indexing, we focus on getting our custom enterprise data into a more consumable format by loading the text content and other artifacts like tables and images, splitting large documents into smaller chunks, converting them into embeddings using an embedder model and then storing these chunks and embeddings into a vector database as depicted in the following figure.
In Step 2 of the workflow, the process begins with the user posing a question. Chunks of relevant documents similar to the input question are retrieved from the vector database. These are then forwarded along with the question to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a human-like response, as depicted in the accompanying figure.
This two-step workflow is commonly used in the industry to build a traditional RAG system; however, it comes with its own set of limitations.
Traditional RAG systems have several limitations, some of which are mentioned as follows:
In this article, we will focus particularly on the limitations of the RAG system, which does not have access to real-time data, as well as make sure the retrieved document chunks are actually relevant to answer the question. This will allow the RAG system to answer questions on more recent events and real-time data and be less prone to hallucinations.
The inspiration for our agentic RAG system will be based on the solution proposed in the paper,* Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation, Yan et al.* , where they propose a workflow as depicted in the following figure to enhance a regular RAG system. The key idea here is to retrieve document chunks from the vector database as usual and then use an LLM to check if each retrieved document chunk is relevant to the input question.
If all the retrieved document chunks are relevant, then it goes to the LLM for a normal response generation like a standard RAG pipeline. However, suppose some retrieved documents are not relevant to the input question. In that case, we rephrase the input query, search the web to retrieve new information related to the input question, and then send it to the LLM to generate a response.
The key novelty in this approach is to search the web, augment static information in the vector database with more live and real-time information, and check if retrieved documents are relevant to the input question, something that cannot be captured by simply embedding cosine similarity.
AI Agents or Agentic AI systems have seen a rise, especially in 2024, which enables us to build Generative AI systems that can reason, analyze, interact, and take actions automatically. The whole idea of Agentic AI is to build completely autonomous systems that can understand and manage complex workflows and tasks with minimal human intervention. Agentic systems can grasp nuanced concepts, set and pursue goals, reason through tasks, and adapt their actions based on changing conditions. These systems can consist of a single agent or even multiple agents, as shown in the example below, where we have two agents working together to ensure the user’s instructions can be transformed into working code snippets.
One can use various frameworks to build Agentic AI systems, including CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, and many more. Using these frameworks enables us to develop complex workflows with ease. Remember, an agent is basically one or more LLMs having access to a set of tools that they can leverage based on specific prompt-based instructions to answer user questions.
We will be using LangGraph for our practical implementation of our Agentic RAG system. LangGraph, built on top of LangChain, facilitates the creation of cyclical graphs essential for developing AI agents powered by LLMs. The widely-used NetworkX library inspires its interface. It enables the coordination and checkpointing of multiple chains (or actors) through cyclic computational steps. LangGraph treats Agent workflows as a cyclical Graph structure, as depicted in the following figure.
The main components in any LangGraph agent include:
LangGraph leverages this to facilitate cyclical LLM call executions with state persistence, which AI agents often require.
In this section, we will see a high-level workflow of the main components in our Agentic RAG system and the execution flow among these components. The following figure illustrates this in detail.
Each component in this workflow is represented by a node. There are two major flows here in this Agentic RAG system. One flow is the regular RAG system workflow, where we have a user question and retrieve context documents from the vector database. However, we introduce an additional step here based on the corrective RAG paper where we use an LLM to check if all retrieved documents are relevant to the user question (in the grade node); if they are all relevant, then we generate a response using an LLM as shown in the following snapshot.
The other flow occurs in case at least one or more of the retrieved context documents from the vector database are irrelevant to the user question, as depicted in the following snapshot. Then, we leverage an LLM to rewrite the user query and optimize it for search on the web. Next, we leverage a web search tool to search the web using this rephrased query and get some new documents. Finally, we send the query and any relevant context documents (including the web search documents) to an LLM to generate a response.
Now, deep dive into a detailed system architecture for our Agentic Corrective RAG System. We will understand each component and what happens step-by-step in the workflow. The following illustration depicts this in detail.
We will start with a user query that goes to the vector database (we will be using Chroma) and retrieves some context documents. There is a possibility that no documents could be retrieved if the user query is based on recent events or topics outside the scope of our initial data in the vector database.
In the next step, we will send our user query and context documents to an LLM and make it act as a document grader. It will grade each context document as **‘Yes’** or **‘No’** depending on whether they are relevant to the user query in terms of meaning and context.
The next step involves the decision node where there are two possible pathways, let’s consider the first path which is taken if ALL the context documents are relevant to the user query.
If all the documents are relevant to the input query, then we go through a standard RAG flow where the documents and query are sent to an LLM to generate a contextual response as an answer for the user query.
The other path is taken from the decision node only if at least one or more context documents are irrelevant to the user query OR there are no context documents for the given user query. Then, we take the user query, send it to an LLM, and ask it to rephrase the user query to optimize it for searching on the web.
The next step involves invoking the web search tool, in our implementation we will be using the Tavily Web Search API tool to search the web and get relevant information as context documents and then add them to the list of any relevant context documents retrieved from the vector database.
The next step is going through the same RAG flow of response generation using the query and context documents, including the real-time information retrieved from the web.
We will now implement the Agentic RAG System we have discussed so far using LangGraph. We will be loading some documents from Wikipedia into our vector database, the Chroma database. and also using the Tavily Search tool for web search. Connections to LLMs and prompting will be made with LangChain, and the agent will be built using LangGraph. For our LLM, we will be using ChatGPT GPT-4o, which is a powerful LLM that has native support for tool calling. However, you are free to use any other LLM, also including open-source LLMs, it is recommended to use a powerful LLM, fine-tuned for tool calling to get the best performance.
We start by installing the necessary dependencies, which are going to be the libraries we will be using to build our system.
```
!pip install langchain==0.2.0
!pip install langchain-openai==0.1.7
!pip install langchain-community==0.2.0
!pip install langgraph==0.1.1
!pip install langchain-chroma==0.1.1
```
We enter our Open AI key using the getpass() function, so we don’t accidentally expose our key in the code.
```
from getpass import getpass
OPENAI_KEY = getpass('Enter Open AI API Key: ')
```
We enter our Open AI key using the getpass() function, so we don’t accidentally expose our key in the code. Get a free API key from here.
`TAVILY_API_KEY = getpass('Enter Tavily Search API Key: ')`
Next, we setup some system environment variables that will be used later when authenticating LLMs and searching APIs.
```
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = OPENAI_KEY
os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = TAVILY_API_KEY
```
We will now build a vector database for retrieval and search by taking a subset of documents from Wikipedia; these documents have already been extracted from Wikipedia and are available in an archived file.
LangChain enables us to access Open AI embedding models, which include the newest models: a smaller and highly efficient text-embedding-3-small model and a larger and more powerful text-embedding-3-large model. We need an embedding model to convert our document chunks into embeddings before storing them in our vector database.
```
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
# details here: https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates
openai_embed_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model='text-embedding-3-small')
```
We have downloaded and made the wikipedia documents available in an archive file on Google Drive, you can either download it manually or use the following library to download it.
*If you can’t download using the following code, go to:*
**Google Drive Link:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oWBnoxBZ1Mpeond8XDUSO6J9oAjcRDyW
*Download it and manually upload it on Google Colab*
**Using Google Colab:** `!gdown 1oWBnoxBZ1Mpeond8XDUSO6J9oAjcRDyW`
We will now unzip the data archive, load the documents, split and chunk them into more manageable document chunks before indexing them.
```
import gzip
import json
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
wikipedia_filepath = 'simplewiki-2020-11-01.jsonl.gz'
docs = []
with gzip.open(wikipedia_filepath, 'rt', encoding='utf8') as fIn:
for line in fIn:
data = json.loads(line.strip())
#Add documents
docs.append({
'metadata': {
'title': data.get('title'),
'article_id': data.get('id')
},
'data': ' '.join(data.get('paragraphs')[0:3])
# restrict data to first 3 paragraphs to run later modules faster
})
# We subset our data to use a subset of wikipedia documents to run things faster
docs = [doc for doc in docs for x in ['india']
if x in doc['data'].lower().split()]
# Create docs
docs = [Document(page_content=doc['data'],
metadata=doc['metadata']) for doc in docs]
# Chunk docs
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=300)
chunked_docs = splitter.split_documents(docs)
chunked_docs[:3]
```
**OUTPUT**
[Document(page_content='Basil ("Ocimum basilicum") ( or ) is a plant of the
Family Lamiaceae. It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi..... but this
likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.',
metadata={'title': 'Basil', 'article_id': '73985'}),
Document(page_content='The Roerich Pact is a treaty on Protection of Artistic
and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments, ...... He became a
successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Nicholas II of
Russia.', metadata={'title': 'Roerich’s Pact', 'article_id': '259745'}),
Document(page_content='Nicolas "Nico" Hülkenberg (born 19 August 1987 in
Emmerich am Rhein, North Rhine-Westphalia) is a German racing driver......
For the season, he is the third driver for the Force India team.', metadata=
{'title': 'Nico Hülkenberg', 'article_id': '260252'})]
Here, we initialize a connection to a Chroma vector DB client, and we also want to save the data to disk, so we simply initialize the Chroma client and pass the directory where we want the data to be saved. We also specify to use the Open AI embedding model to transform each document chunk into an embedding and to store the document chunks and their corresponding embeddings in the vector database index.
```
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
# create vector DB of docs and embeddings - takes < 30s on Colab
chroma_db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunked_docs,
collection_name='rag_wikipedia_db',
embedding=openai_embed_model,
# need to set the distance function to cosine else it uses Euclidean by default
# check https://docs.trychroma.com/guides#changing-the-distance-function
collection_metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"},
persist_directory="./wikipedia_db")
```
Here, we use the Similarity with Threshold Retrieval strategy, which uses cosine similarity and retrieves the top 3 similar documents based on the user input query and also introduces a cutoff to not return any documents that are below a certain similarity threshold (0.3 in this case).
```
similarity_threshold_retriever = chroma_db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
search_kwargs={"k": 3,
"score_threshold": 0.3})
We can then test if our retriever is working on some sample queries.
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
top3_docs
```
**OUTPUT**
[Document(page_content='New Delhi () is the capital of India and a union
territory of the megacity of Delhi. .......population of about 9.4 Million
people.', metadata={'article_id': '5117', 'title': 'New Delhi'}),
Document(page_content="Mumbai (previously known as Bombay until 1996) is a
natural harbor on the west coast of India, and is the capital city of
Maharashtra state. ...... It also has the Hindi film and television
industry, known as Bollywood.", metadata={'article_id': '5114', 'title':
'Mumbai'}),
Document(page_content='The Republic of India is divided into twenty-eight
States,and ...... Territory.', metadata={'article_id': '22215', 'title':
'States and union territories of India'})]
For queries without relevant documents in the vector database, we will get an empty list, as shown in the following example query.
```
query = "what is langgraph?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
top3_docs
```
**OUTPUT**
Here, we will use an LLM itself to grade if any retrieved document is relevant to the given question – The answer will be either yes or no. The LLM, in our case, will be GPT-4o.
```
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# Data model for LLM output format
class GradeDocuments(BaseModel):
"""Binary score for relevance check on retrieved documents."""
binary_score: str = Field(
description="Documents are relevant to the question, 'yes' or 'no'"
)
# LLM for grading
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
structured_llm_grader = llm.with_structured_output(GradeDocuments)
# Prompt template for grading
SYS_PROMPT = """You are an expert grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question.

- If the document contains keyword(s) or semantic meaning related to the question, grade it as relevant.

grade_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
[
("system", SYS_PROMPT),
("human", """Retrieved document:

]
)
# Build grader chain
doc_grader = (grade_prompt
|
structured_llm_grader)
```
We can test out this grader on some sample user queries and see how relevant are the retrieved context documents from the vector database.
```
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
for doc in top3_docs:
print(doc.page_content)
print('GRADE:', doc_grader.invoke({"question": query,
"document": doc.page_content}))
print()
```
**OUTPUT**
New Delhi () is the capital of India ......
GRADE: binary_score='yes'
Mumbai (previously known as Bombay until 1996) ......
GRADE: binary_score='no'
The Republic of India is divided ......
GRADE: binary_score='no'
We can see that the LLM does a pretty good job of detecting relevant and irrelevant documents about the user query.
Here, we will connect our retriever to an LLM, GPT-4o, in our case, and build our Question-answering RAG chain. Remember, this will be our traditional RAG system, which we will integrate with an AI Agent later.

```
The idea here is to get the user query, retrieve the context documents from the vector database or web search, and then send them as inputs to the RAG prompt mentioned above, which goes into GPT-4o to generate a human-like response. Let’s test out a few queries in our traditional RAG system now.
```
query = "what is the capital of India?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_rag_chain.invoke(
{"context": top3_docs, "question": query}
)
print(result)
```
**OUTPUT**
The capital of India is New Delhi. It is also a union territory and part of
the megacity of Delhi.
Let’s now try a question that is out of context, such that no context documents related to the question are there in the vector database.
```
query = "who won the champions league in 2024?"
top3_docs = similarity_threshold_retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_rag_chain.invoke(
{"context": top3_docs, "question": query}
)
print(result)
```
**OUTPUT**
I don't know the answer. The provided context does not contain information
about the winner of the Champions League in 2024.
The RAG system behaves as expected; the shortcoming here is that it cannot answer out-of-context questions, which is what we will try to improve on in the next steps

We will now build a query rephraser, which will use an LLM, GPT-4o in our case, to rephrase the input user query into a better version that is optimized for web search. This will help us get better context information from the web for our query.
```
# LLM for question rewriting
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
# Prompt template for rewriting
SYS_PROMPT = """Act as a question re-writer and perform the following task:

),
]
)
# Create rephraser chain
question_rewriter = (re_write_prompt

```
Let’s try this on a sample question to see how our rephraser chain works.
```
query = "who won the champions league in 2024?"
question_rewriter.invoke({"question": query})
```
**OUTPUT**
Who was the winner of the 2024 UEFA Champions League?
Here, we will use the Tavily API for our web searches, so we load up a connection to this API. For our searches, we will use the top 3 search results as additional context information; however, you are free to load in more search results.
```
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
tv_search = TavilySearchResults(max_results=3, search_depth='advanced',max_tokens=10000)
```
Here, we will build the key components of our Agentic Corrective RAG System as per the workflow we discussed earlier in our guide. These functions will be put into relevant agent nodes via LangGraph later on when we build our agent.
This is used to store and represent the state of the agent graph as we traverse through various nodes. It will store and keep track of the user query, a flag variable telling us if a web search is needed, a list of context documents (retrieved from the vector database and \ or web search), and the LLM-generated response.
```

question: str
generation: str
web_search_needed: str
documents: List[str]
```
This will be used to get relevant context documents from the vector database using our retriever, which we built earlier. Remember, as this will be a node in the agent graph, later on, we will be getting the user question from the graph state and then pass it to our retriever to get relevant context documents from the vector database.
```

return {"documents": documents, "question": question}
```
This will be used to determine whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the question using an LLM Grader. It sets the web_search_needed flag as Yes if at least one document is not contextually relevant OR no context documents were retrieved. Otherwise, it sets the flag as No if all documents are contextually relevant to the given user query. It updates the state graph by ensuring context documents consist of only relevant documents.

This will be used to search the web using the web search tool for the given query and retrieve some information from the web, which can be used as additional context documents in our RAG system.

This will be used as a conditional function to check the web_search_needed flag from the agent graph state and decide if a web search or response should be generated, and return the function name to be called. It will return the rewrite_query string if a web search is needed, as then our agentic RAG system would go into the flow of query rephrasing, followed by search and then response generation. If a web search is unnecessary, the function will return the generate_answer string, enabling our RAG system to go into the regular flow of generating a response from the given context documents and query. This function will be used in the conditional node in our agent graph to help route the flow to the right function based on the two possible pathways.

 ## Paper Review: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Time Series Analysis
The proposed approach introduces a novel framework for time series analysis using a multi-agent RAG system. This framework addresses challenges such as complex spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution shifts in time series data. It employs a hierarchical architecture where a master agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents, each fine-tuned for specific time series tasks. These sub-agents use smaller pre-trained language models and retrieve relevant prompts from a shared repository to enhance predictions. The modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various time series tasks.
### Problem formulation
The dataset consists of N univariate time series, each collected over T timestamps. It is represented as a data matrix. There are four tasks:
- Forecasting: A sliding window is used to construct subsequences from previous steps to predict future values for the next steps.
- Missing Data Imputation: A binary mask matrix identifies missing data, and observed samples are used to estimate missing values by leveraging spatio-temporal dependencies within a sliding window.
- Anomaly Detection: Anomalies are detected by comparing current behavior with the normal pattern from a training period. A sliding window approach is used to predict future values, and anomaly scores are computed to flag deviations from the moving averaged maximum anomaly value.
- Classification: Unsupervised K-means clustering is applied to identify clusters in the data. A sliding window approach is used to predict future cluster labels based on past time steps.
### The approach
#### Dynamic Prompting Mechanism
A dynamic prompting mechanism enhances time series modeling by addressing non-stationarity and distributional shifts. It improves traditional methods that use fixed window lengths, which may miss short-range or long-range dependencies. The approach retrieves relevant prompts from a shared pool of key-value pairs encoding historical patterns like seasonality, cyclicality, irregularities, etc. Input time series are projected into a vector space, and cosine similarity is used to match them with the most relevant prompts. These prompts are combined with the input data to improve predictions, allowing the model to adapt and leverage past knowledge for better performance across varying datasets.
#### Fine-Tuning/Preference Optimization SLM
Pretrained small language models, like Google’s Gemma and Meta’s Llama-3, are limited by an 8K token context window, which hinders their ability to process long input sequences. To address this, a two-tiered attention mechanism (grouped and neighbor attention) is introduced, allowing SLMs to capture long-range dependencies without fine-tuning, improving performance on extended text sequences. While fine-tuning SLMs for specific tasks can enhance performance, instruction-tuning with an extended 32K token context window, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, improves their ability to handle time series tasks. Additionally, Direct DPO is used to steer SLM predictions toward more reliable task-specific outcomes by randomly masking 50% of the data and performing binary classification to predict correct task-specific outcomes.
### Experiments
The Agentic-RAG framework variants were evaluated against baseline methods on seven benchmark datasets for forecasting, as well as on anomaly detection tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods across these datasets.
An ablation study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual components within the Agentic-RAG framework. The study analyzed the impact of removing key components: dynamic prompting mechanism, sub-agent specialization, instruction-tuning, and DPO. Results showed that the full framework consistently outperformed ablated versions in time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification tasks across multiple datasets.

 # RAG vs. Traditional AI: A Comparative Analysis of Accuracy and Efficiency
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized industries, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with technology. Among the vast array of AI techniques, two approaches stand out for their distinct methodologies and applications: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Traditional AI. As AI continues to evolve, understanding the differences between these approaches, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency, becomes crucial. This blog provides a comprehensive analysis of RAG and Traditional AI, comparing their strengths, limitations, and potential future developments.
**1. Introduction to Traditional AI**
**Traditional AI** encompasses a wide range of algorithms and methodologies developed over the decades. These include rule-based systems, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Traditional AI models, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, rely heavily on large datasets to learn patterns and make predictions.
**1.1 How Traditional AI Works**
Traditional AI models are trained on labeled datasets, where the model learns to map input data to output labels. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual label. This process is repeated over numerous iterations, with the model gradually improving its accuracy.
For example, in image classification, a traditional AI model might be trained on thousands of labeled images, learning to recognize features that distinguish one class from another. Similarly, in natural language processing (NLP), models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are trained on massive text corpora to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences.
**1.2 Strengths of Traditional AI**
Traditional AI has several strengths that have contributed to its widespread adoption:
**Versatility:**Traditional AI models can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to language translation, medical diagnosis, and more.**Maturity:**With decades of research and development, traditional AI techniques are well-understood and have been refined over time.**Predictive Power:**Advanced traditional AI models, particularly deep learning models, have demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy in various domains.
**1.3 Limitations of Traditional AI**
Despite its strengths, traditional AI has limitations:
**Data Dependency:**Traditional AI models require large amounts of labeled data for training. Acquiring and labeling such data can be time-consuming and expensive.**Computational Resources:**Training deep learning models, in particular, requires significant computational power and time, which can be costly.**Black-Box Nature:**Many traditional AI models, especially deep neural networks, are considered "black boxes" because their decision-making processes are not easily interpretable.
**2. Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a relatively new approach in the field of AI that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generative models. RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses based on a large knowledge base.
**2.1 How RAG Works**
RAG models work by first retrieving relevant information from a pre-existing knowledge base and then using that information to generate a response. The process can be broken down into two main components:
**Retrieval:**The model searches a large database or knowledge base to find documents or pieces of information that are relevant to the input query. This step is typically performed using techniques like dense passage retrieval or BM25, which rank documents based on their relevance to the query.**Generation:**Once the relevant information is retrieved, the model uses a generative model, such as GPT, to produce a response. The retrieved information acts as a context or guide for the generation process, ensuring that the output is both relevant and accurate.
**2.2 Strengths of RAG**
RAG offers several advantages over traditional AI approaches:
**Contextual Relevance:**By retrieving relevant information before generating a response, RAG models are better equipped to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.**Efficiency:**RAG models can generate accurate responses without requiring extensive training on large datasets. Instead, they leverage existing knowledge bases, making them more efficient in terms of training and inference.**Flexibility:**RAG models can be easily updated or adapted to new domains by simply updating the knowledge base, without the need for retraining the entire model.
**2.3 Limitations of RAG**
While RAG is a powerful approach, it also has its limitations:
**Dependency on Knowledge Base:**The accuracy of RAG models is heavily dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the underlying knowledge base. If the knowledge base is incomplete or outdated, the model's performance may suffer.**Complexity:**Implementing RAG models can be more complex than traditional AI models, as they require both a retrieval mechanism and a generative model to work together seamlessly.**Scalability:**As the size of the knowledge base grows, the retrieval process can become more computationally intensive, potentially affecting the model's efficiency.
**3. Comparative Analysis of Accuracy**
**Accuracy** is a critical metric in evaluating AI models, particularly in applications where incorrect predictions can have significant consequences, such as healthcare or finance. Both RAG and traditional AI models offer unique advantages in terms of accuracy, but their effectiveness can vary depending on the task at hand.
**3.1 Accuracy in Traditional AI**
Traditional AI models, particularly those based on deep learning, have demonstrated impressive accuracy in a wide range of tasks. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in image recognition, while transformers have revolutionized NLP with their ability to understand and generate human-like text.
However, the accuracy of traditional AI models is often contingent on the availability of large, labeled datasets. In domains where such data is scarce or difficult to obtain, traditional AI models may struggle to achieve high accuracy. Moreover, these models can sometimes overfit to the training data, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data.
**3.2 Accuracy in RAG**
RAG models offer a different approach to achieving accuracy. By leveraging a vast knowledge base, RAG models can retrieve relevant information that may not be explicitly encoded in the training data. This can be particularly advantageous in tasks where the input query is highly specific or requires up-to-date information that a traditional AI model may not have encountered during training.
For example, in open-domain question answering, RAG models have shown superior accuracy compared to traditional AI models by retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus and using that information to generate precise answers. Similarly, in customer support applications, RAG models can provide accurate responses by retrieving relevant knowledge articles or FAQs.
However, the accuracy of RAG models is heavily influenced by the quality of the knowledge base. If the knowledge base contains outdated or incorrect information, the model's accuracy will suffer. Additionally, the retrieval process itself may introduce errors if the model retrieves irrelevant or low-quality documents.
**3.3 Comparative Analysis**
When comparing accuracy between RAG and traditional AI models, several factors come into play:
**Data Availability:**In scenarios where large, labeled datasets are available, traditional AI models may achieve higher accuracy due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data. However, in domains where labeled data is scarce, RAG models may have an edge by leveraging a knowledge base to fill in the gaps.**Task Complexity:**For tasks that require understanding and generating contextually relevant responses, such as conversational AI or open-domain question answering, RAG models may offer superior accuracy by retrieving and using external information. On the other hand, for tasks like image classification or structured data prediction, traditional AI models may be more accurate.**Knowledge Base Quality:**The accuracy of RAG models is directly tied to the quality of the knowledge base. If the knowledge base is comprehensive, up-to-date, and relevant, RAG models can achieve high accuracy. However, if the knowledge base is flawed, the model's accuracy will be compromised.
**4. Comparative Analysis of Efficiency**
**Efficiency** is another crucial factor in evaluating AI models, particularly in real-time applications where speed and resource consumption are critical. Both RAG and traditional AI models have unique efficiency characteristics that can impact their suitability for different use cases.
**4.1 Efficiency in Traditional AI**
Traditional AI models, particularly deep learning models, can be computationally expensive to train and deploy. Training deep neural networks often requires significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs and large amounts of memory. This can make traditional AI models less efficient in terms of both time and cost, especially for large-scale applications.
However, once trained, traditional AI models can be highly efficient in terms of inference speed. For example, image classification models can process images in real-time, making them suitable for applications like autonomous vehicles or real-time video analysis. Additionally, many traditional AI models can be optimized for deployment using techniques like model pruning or quantization, further improving their efficiency.
**4.2 Efficiency in RAG**
RAG models offer a different efficiency profile. Since RAG models rely on retrieving information from a knowledge base rather than learning all patterns from scratch, they can be more efficient in terms of training. Instead of requiring vast amounts of labeled data, RAG models can be quickly adapted to new domains by simply updating the knowledge base.
However, the retrieval process in RAG models can be computationally intensive, particularly as the size of the knowledge base grows. Searching through millions of documents to find relevant information can take time, potentially impacting the model's efficiency in real-time applications. Moreover, the integration of retrieval and generation components adds complexity to the model, which can further affect efficiency.
**4.3 Comparative Analysis**
When comparing efficiency between RAG and traditional AI models, several factors should be considered:
**Training Efficiency:**RAG models can be more efficient in terms of training, as they do not require large labeled datasets. Traditional AI models, on the other hand, may require extensive training on large datasets, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.**Inference Efficiency:**Traditional AI models often excel in inference efficiency, particularly in scenarios where real-time processing is required. RAG models, while efficient in terms of training, may be less efficient during inference due to the computational cost of the retrieval process.**Resource Requirements:**Traditional AI models, particularly deep learning models, often require significant computational resources for both training and inference. RAG models may have lower resource requirements during training but could demand more computational power during inference due to the need for retrieval.
**5. Applications and Use Cases**
The choice between RAG and traditional AI models often depends on the specific application and use case. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses that make it more suitable for certain tasks.
**5.1 Applications of Traditional AI**
Traditional AI models are widely used in various applications, including:
**Image and Video Analysis:**Traditional AI models, particularly CNNs, are widely used for image and video analysis, including facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.**Natural Language Processing:**Traditional AI models like transformers have revolutionized NLP, enabling applications like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.**Predictive Analytics:**Traditional AI models, particularly those based on statistical methods and machine learning, are commonly used for predictive analytics in finance, healthcare, and marketing.**Robotics:**Traditional AI models are used in robotics for tasks like object manipulation, path planning, and human-robot interaction.
**5.2 Applications of RAG**
RAG models are particularly useful in applications where generating accurate and contextually relevant responses is crucial, including:
**Conversational AI:**RAG models are well-suited for chatbots and virtual assistants, where they can retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base to provide accurate responses to user queries.**Open-Domain Question Answering:**RAG models excel in open-domain question answering, where they can retrieve and synthesize information from large corpora to answer complex queries.**Customer Support:**RAG models can be used in customer support applications to provide accurate and timely responses by retrieving relevant knowledge articles or FAQs.**Content Generation:**RAG models can be used to generate content, such as news articles or marketing copy, by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to generate text.

Agents are equipped to perform query planning tasks by analyzing input queries and selecting suitable tools from a predefined set of existing tools within the RAG system. This allows agents to optimize the selection of tools based on the query requirements and desired outcomes.**Selection of tools from the candidate pool**:
In situations where the RAG system offers a wide array of tools, agents can help choose the most suitable one from the pool of candidate tools retrieved according to the query. This selection process ensures that the chosen tool aligns closely with the query context and objectives.
These usage patterns can be combined and customized to create complex RAG applications tailored to specific use cases and requirements. Through harnessing these patterns, agents operating within a RAG framework can efficiently accomplish various tasks, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
## Agentic RAG: Extending traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines with intelligent agents
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of the traditional RAG framework that incorporates the concept of agents to enhance the capabilities and functionality of the system. In an agentic RAG, agents are used to orchestrate and manage the various components of the RAG pipeline, as well as to perform additional tasks and reasoning that go beyond simple information retrieval and generation.
In a traditional RAG system, the pipeline typically consists of the following components:
**Query/Prompt**: The user’s input query or prompt.**Retriever**: A component that searches through a knowledge base to retrieve relevant information related to the query.**Knowledge base**: The external data source containing the information to be retrieved.**Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful language model that generates an output based on the query and the retrieved information.
In an agentic RAG, agents are introduced to enhance and extend the functionality of this pipeline. Here’s a detailed explanation of how agents are integrated into the RAG framework:
### 1. Query understanding and decomposition
- Agents can be used to understand the user’s query or prompt better, identify its intent, and decompose it into sub-tasks or sub-queries that can be more effectively handled by the RAG pipeline.
- For example, a complex query like “Provide a summary of the latest developments in quantum computing and their potential impact on cybersecurity” could be broken down into sub-queries like “Retrieve information on recent advancements in quantum computing” and “Retrieve information on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity.”
### 2. Knowledge base management
- Agents can curate and manage the knowledge base used by the RAG system.
- This includes identifying relevant sources of information, extracting and structuring data from these sources, and updating the knowledge base with new or revised information.
- Agents can also select the most appropriate knowledge base or subset of the knowledge base for a given query or task.
### 3. Retrieval strategy selection and optimization
- Agents can select the most suitable retrieval strategy (for example, keyword matching, semantic similarity, neural retrieval) based on the query or task at hand.
- They can also fine-tune and optimize the retrieval process for better performance, considering factors like query complexity, domain-specific knowledge requirements, and available computational resources.
### 4. Result synthesis and post-processing
- After the RAG pipeline generates an initial output, agents can synthesize and post-process the result.
- This may involve combining information from multiple retrieved sources, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring the final output is coherent, accurate, and well-structured.
- Agents can also apply additional reasoning, decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge to enhance the output further.
### 5. Iterative querying and feedback loop
- Agents can facilitate an iterative querying process, where users can provide feedback, clarify their queries, or request additional information.
- Based on this feedback, agents can refine the RAG pipeline, update the knowledge base, or adjust the retrieval and generation strategies accordingly.
### 6. Task orchestration and coordination
- For complex tasks that require multiple steps or sub-tasks, agents can orchestrate and coordinate the execution of these sub-tasks through the RAG pipeline.
- Agents can manage the flow of information, distribute sub-tasks to different components or models, and combine the intermediate results into a final output.
### 7. Multimodal integration
- Agents can facilitate the integration of multimodal data sources (e.g., images, videos, audio) into the RAG pipeline.
- This allows for more comprehensive information retrieval and generation capabilities, enabling the system to handle queries or tasks that involve multiple modalities.
### 8. Continuous learning and adaptation
- Agents can monitor the RAG system’s performance, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
- This may involve updating the knowledge base, fine-tuning retrieval strategies, or adjusting other components of the RAG pipeline based on user feedback, performance metrics, or changes in the underlying data or domain.
By integrating agents into the RAG framework, agentic RAG systems can become more flexible and adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks that require reasoning, decision-making, and coordination across multiple components and modalities. Agents act as intelligent orchestrators and facilitators, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the RAG pipeline.
## Types of agentic RAG based on function
RAG agents can be categorized based on their function, offering a spectrum of capabilities ranging from simple to complex, with varying costs and latency. They can serve purposes like routing, one-shot query planning, utilizing tools, employing reason + act (ReAct) methodology, and orchestrating dynamic planning and execution.
### Routing agent
The routing agent employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine which downstream RAG pipeline to select. This process constitutes agentic reasoning, wherein the LLM analyzes the input query to make an informed decision about selecting the most suitable RAG pipeline. This represents the fundamental and simple form of agentic reasoning.
An alternative routing involves choosing between summarization and question-answering RAG pipelines. The agent evaluates the input query to decide whether to direct it to the summary query engine or the vector query engine, both configured as tools.
### One-shot query planning agent
The query planning agent divides a complex query into parallelizable subqueries, each of which can be executed across various RAG pipelines based on different data sources. The responses from these pipelines are then amalgamated into the final response. Basically, in query planning, the initial step involves breaking down the query into subqueries, executing each one across suitable RAG pipelines, and synthesizing the results into a comprehensive response.
### Tool use agent
In a typical RAG, a query is submitted to retrieve the most relevant documents that semantically match the query. However, there are instances where additional data is required from external sources such as an API, an SQL database, or an application with an API interface. This additional data serves as context to enhance the input query before it is processed by the LLM. In such cases, the agent can utilize a RAG too spec.
### ReAct agent
ReAct = Reason + Act with LLMs
Moving to a higher level involves incorporating reasoning and actions that are executed iteratively over a complex query. Essentially, this encompasses a combination of routing, query planning, and tool use into a single entity. A ReAct agent is capable of handling sequential multi-part queries while maintaining state (in memory). The process involves the following steps:
- Upon receiving a user input query, the agent determines the appropriate tool to utilize, if necessary, and gathers the requisite input for the tool.
- The tool is invoked with the necessary input, and its output is stored.
- The agent then receives the tool’s history, including both input and output and, based on this information, determines the subsequent course of action.
- This process iterates until the agent completes tasks and responds to the user.
### Dynamic planning & execution agent
ReAct currently stands as the most widely adopted agent; however, there’s a growing necessity to address more intricate user intents. As the deployment of agents in production environments increases, there’s a heightened demand for enhanced reliability, observability, parallelization, control, and separation of concerns. Essentially, there’s a requirement for long-term planning, execution insight, efficiency optimization, and latency reduction.
At a fundamental level, these efforts aim to segregate higher-level planning from short-term execution. The rationale behind such agents involves:
- Outlining the necessary steps to fulfill an input query plan, essentially creating the entire computational graph or directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Determine the tools, if any, required for executing each step in the plan and perform them with the necessary inputs.
This necessitates the presence of both a planner and an executor. The planner typically utilizes a large language model (LLM) to craft a step-by-step plan based on the user query. Thereupon, the executor executes each step, identifying the tools needed to accomplish the tasks outlined in the plan. This iterative process continues until the entire plan is executed, resulting in the presentation of the final response.

# Understanding Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a cutting-edge approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generation-based models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The term “agentic” emphasizes the model’s ability to act autonomously, making decisions based on retrieved information to generate responses.
# Agentic RAG Architecture
## The Core Components
The architecture of Agentic RAG is built upon two primary components: the retriever and the generator.
**Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant information from a vast corpus of data. It uses sophisticated search algorithms to find the most pertinent pieces of information based on the input query.**Generator**: Once the retriever has fetched the necessary information, the generator takes over. It uses this information to craft coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This component typically relies on advanced transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
## Integration and Workflow
The workflow in an Agentic RAG system begins with the input query, which is processed by the retriever. The retriever’s output is then fed into the generator, which produces the final response. This integration ensures that the generated content is not only contextually relevant but also enriched with accurate information retrieved from external sources.
# Agentic Framework in LLM
The agentic framework in large language models (LLMs) is a significant enhancement over traditional models. It allows the model to autonomously retrieve and integrate information, leading to more dynamic and informed responses.
## Autonomous Information Retrieval
In a traditional LLM, the model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate responses. However, in an agentic framework, the model actively retrieves additional information in real-time. This autonomy ensures that the model’s outputs are not limited to its training data, enabling it to provide more up-to-date and accurate information.
## Dynamic Response Generation
By combining retrieved information with its generative capabilities, an agentic LLM can produce responses that are both informative and contextually appropriate. This dynamic response generation is particularly beneficial in applications requiring precise and current information, such as customer support, research, and content creation.

 # Agentic RAG
Alright, let’s get straight to the meat of the matter — understanding the Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach and how it’s revolutionizing the way we handle information. Buckle up, because this is about to get wild!
At its core, **Agentic RAG **is all about injecting intelligence and autonomy into the RAG framework. It’s like giving a regular RAG system a major upgrade, transforming it into an autonomous agent capable of making its own decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Pretty cool, right?
# But what exactly does this mean in practice? Well, let me break it down for you.
**Context is King:** One of the biggest limitations of traditional RAG implementations was their inability to truly understand and factor in the broader conversational context. Agentic RAG agents, on the other hand, are designed to be context-aware. They can grasp the nuances of a dialogue, consider the history, and adapt their behavior accordingly. This means more coherent and relevant responses, as if the agent is truly engaged in a natural conversation.
**Intelligent Retrieval Strategies:** Remember how RAG systems used to rely on static rules for retrieval? Boring! Agentic RAG agents are way smarter than that. They employ intelligent retrieval strategies, dynamically assessing the user’s query, available tools (data sources), and contextual cues to determine the most appropriate retrieval action. It’s like having a personal assistant who knows exactly where to look for the information you need.
**Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Now, here’s where things get really interesting. Complex queries often span multiple documents or data sources, right? Well, in the world of Agentic RAG, we’ve got a little something called multi-agent orchestration. Imagine having multiple specialized agents, each an expert in their own domain or data source, collaborating and synthesizing their findings to provide you with a comprehensive response. It’s like having a team of experts working together to solve your toughest problems.
**Agentic Reasoning:** But wait, there’s more! Agentic RAG agents aren’t just good at retrieving information; they’re also equipped with reasoning capabilities that go way beyond simple retrieval and generation. These agents can perform evaluations, corrections, and quality checks on the retrieved data, ensuring that the output you receive is accurate and reliable. No more worrying about getting questionable information!
**Post-Generation Verification:** And just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Agentic RAG agents can perform post-generation checks. They can verify the truthfulness of the generated content, or even run multiple generations and select the best result for you. Talk about attention to detail!
**Adaptability and Learning:** Here’s the real kicker — Agentic RAG architectures can be designed to incorporate learning mechanisms, allowing the agents to adapt and improve their performance over time. It’s like having a system that gets smarter and more efficient the more you use it. How’s that for future-proofing?
# Agentic RAG Reference Architecture Demystified
Alright, now that we’ve got a good understanding of what Agentic RAG is all about, let’s dive into the reference architecture that makes this whole thing work.
At the heart of this architecture, we have the Agentic RAG Agent — the intelligent orchestrator that receives user queries and decides on the appropriate course of action. Think of it as the conductor of a symphony, coordinating all the different instruments (tools) to create a harmonious performance.
Now, this agent isn’t alone in its endeavors. It’s equipped with a suite of tools, each associated with a specific set of documents or data sources. These tools are like specialized agents or functions that can retrieve, process, and generate information from their respective data sources.
For example, let’s say you have Tool 1, which is responsible for accessing and processing financial statements, and Tool 2, which handles customer data. The Agentic RAG Agent can dynamically select and combine these tools based on your query, enabling it to synthesize information from multiple sources to provide you with a comprehensive response.
But wait, where does all this information come from? That’s where the documents or data sources come into play. These can be structured or unstructured, ranging from databases and knowledge bases to textual documents and multimedia content. They’re like the raw materials that the tools work with to craft the final product.
Now, let’s say you ask the agent a complex question that spans multiple domains or data sources. Here’s where the magic happens: the Agentic RAG Agent orchestrates the entire process, determining which tools to employ, retrieving relevant information from the associated data sources, and generating a final response tailored specifically to your query.
Throughout this process, the agent leverages intelligent reasoning, context awareness, and post-generation verification techniques to ensure that the output you receive is not only accurate but also tailored to your needs.
Of course, this is just a simplified representation of the reference architecture. In the real world, Agentic RAG implementations may involve additional components, such as language models, knowledge bases, and other supporting systems, depending on the specific use case and requirements.
# Agentic RAG Expanding Horizons
